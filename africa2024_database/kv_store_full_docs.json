African leaders pledge to increase the share of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics locally manufactured in Africa to 60% by 2040. This vision will be achieved by establishing a sustainable vaccine development and manufacturing ecosystem underpinned by research and development, intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer, robust regulatory systems, innovative and sustainable financing, strategic partnerships, and commitment by African and global procurement agencies to purchase vaccines produced on the continent.\nSince the late 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided a safety, quality, and efficacy assurance assessment process, now known as “WHO prequalification” (PQ), to ensure vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and other health products supplied by procurement agencies meet acceptable standards and to facilitate the regulatory review and uptake of health products in Iow-resource settings.\nIn Africa, the slow process of WHO PQ was seen as one of the key limitations on the way to achieving the local manufacturing agenda. In this context, Africa CDC welcomes the new\nWHO policy\nto initiate parallel processes both for recommendation guidelines and PQ or Emergency Use Listing Procedure (EUL) assessment as an important step in addressing the inequity in rapidly accessing essential and innovative health products. The use of interim guidelines, especially for innovator products, will be useful in accelerating timelines. Nevertheless, they require significant efforts to address the high data and evidence standards, know how to produce a complete dossier for submission and interact with PQ’s consultation processes.\nOne of the critical and intrinsic factors for sustainable manufacturing in Africa is ensuring that African manufacturers have access to efficient and harmonized regulatory pathways that ensure high-quality products and market access for African-made products. The acquisition of maturity level 3 (ML3) status in five (5) African countries, coupled with ongoing competency programs through Regional Centres for Regulatory Excellence (RCOREs), underscores the critical importance for African regulatory experts to possess expertise and capabilities that align with adequate regulatory oversight across the entire lifecycle of vaccine production.\nLengthy and fragmented processes to acquire regulatory approval will lead to late market access and financial and administrative burdens for African manufacturers. In addressing this,\nachieving WHO prequalification to enter the United Nations (UN) procurement system\nis particularly important for African manufacturers to reach the economics of scales necessary to foster a conducive manufacturing eco-system, including Research and Development. We encourage WHO to continue to support the strengthening of these important activities and engagement and communication across diverse stakeholder communities. Africa CDC will continue to monitor the progress and execution of these and similar recommendations for the benefits of local manufacturing of pharmaceutical products in Africa.\n3 April 2024\nTheme\nRespectful Partnership\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

CEPI stands ready to support Africa CDC in the realisation of these goals and to further strengthen Africa’s preparedness and resilience against future outbreaks.”\nIn line with the African Union’s (A.U.) ambition to produce 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs in Africa by 2040 under the Africa CDC’s Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM);  the expanded partnership will ultimately focus its efforts on enhancing research and development, building a workforce as well as supply chain optimization to support resilient health systems This ambition will increase vaccine sovereignty and reduce external reliance, helping prevent a recurrence of the vaccine inequity seen during the COVID-19 response in Africa.\nTo boost vaccine accessibility and efficiency and meet this goal, there is a need to invest in vaccine R&D and manufacturing innovations, amongst others, and build a resilient regional supply chain. To that end, Africa CDC and CEPI will coordinate to fund innovations accelerating speed, scale, or accessibility for initial implementation with African manufacturers. This investment will support sustainable manufacturing for routine vaccinations in Africa, and—in the event of an outbreak—these facilities can be mobilized to produce response vaccines promptly.\nIn alignment with Africa CDC, the partnership also aims to bolster Africa’s research ecosystem and clinical trial infrastructure, including targeted capacity strengthening through CEPI’s\nResearch Preparedness Program\n—which, directed by regional experts, aims to build capacity for conducting high-quality Phase 3 efficacy trials.\nBuilding on existing clinical trial capability in some African countries is vital as vaccine candidates against endemic diseases, such as\nLassa fever\n, progress into late-stage development. Phase 3 trials provide essential data required for vaccine approval and must take place in regions where the disease is prevalent. A\nCEPI-funded Phase 2 trial for a Lassa fever vaccine\ncandidate is already underway; it is crucial that if this candidate, or another, is successful, there is regional capability to further its path toward licensure. Once established, this capability can benefit other regional actors advancing to late-stage research.\nThe organizations will also collaborate to enhance vaccine safety protocols, biosecurity, pathogen surveillance, investment in capacity building, and other areas that help ensure overall African readiness for emergency vaccine responses.\nAfrica CDC and CEPI are committed to this cooperation, which will strengthen collaboration and deliver tangible results to deliver Africa’s long-term health security ambitions.\n—END\n—\nNotes to Editors\nAbout CEPI\nCEPI was launched in 2017 as an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civil organisations. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic disease threats and enable equitable access to them. CEPI has supported the development of more than 50 vaccine candidates or platform technologies against multiple known high-risk pathogens and is also advancing the development of rapid response platforms for vaccines against a future Disease X. Central to CEPI’s pandemic-beating five-year plan for 2022-2026 is the ‘100 Days Mission’ to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days.\nAbout Africa CDC\nAbout Africa CDC: The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

The Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative, a bold and unprecedented $1.5 billion partnership, was launched in June 2021. This innovative and ground-breaking partnership aimed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, roll out vaccinations, build the vaccine manufacturing workforce for the continent, and strengthen the Africa CDC to ensure long-term health security for Africa.\nUnprecedented in scale, speed and inclusion of African organisations, the partnership has\ncontributed to the continent’s current vaccination rate of 53 per cent of\nthe target population, up from just 3 per cent at the start of the initiative. The partnership has also trained, equipped, and deployed 38,000 health workers, creating a robust frontline in safeguarding public health locally. It has provided job opportunities for 23,000 individuals and integrated over 600 COVID-19 vaccination centres into healthcare systems. Additionally, this initiative led to the expansion of genomic testing capabilities from seven to 40 laboratories across the continent.\nThe review of Phase 1 of this initiative, among fifteen implementing partners across 29 countries, conducted by Deloitte, indicates that the vast majority of funds disbursed were used effectively and as intended. Likewise, ongoing monitoring by KPMG has confirmed that partners not only showed strength in programmatic results but also improved the institutional capacity for greater sustainability and institutional resilience.\n“Our Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative with the Mastercard Foundation has shown the power of respectful and action-oriented partnerships rooted in collaboration, coordination and systems strengthening. The experience and learnings from Phase I will enable us to move with greater speed and scale to deliver with accelerated impact to our member states” said\nDr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC\n.\nIn its second phase, the partnership will expand its scope and scale, focusing on completing the vaccination of healthcare workers and vulnerable groups, building a robust workforce of community health workers, ensuring pandemic preparedness by bolstering national public health institutions, laboratory capacities, data access and quality, local manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, and continuing strengthening of Africa CDC.\n“While the global pandemic may be declared over, the need to continue investing in our health systems, build our workforce and prepare for future pandemics remains urgent. This partnership will ensure that we have strong health institutions and systems. We aim to enable thousands of young people to build their careers in healthcare and contribute to improving lives in Africa,” said\nReeta Roy, President, and CEO of the Mastercard Foundation.\nThe Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative stands out as a testament to the power of African-led health solutions. As it progresses to its next phase, partnerships will continue to play a crucial role in shaping a New Public Health Order for Africa.

The partnership is expected to have a significant impact on public health in Africa by strengthening procurement and supply chain systems, with a particular focus on immunisation for children across the continent.\nH.E Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of Africa CDC, and Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations, signed the expanded partnership agreement in Addis Ababa.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of many healthcare systems and highlighted deficiencies and challenges in medical supply chains. While countries with strong primary healthcare systems were better able to cope, the disruption caused by the pandemic left others facing shortages of vital medical commodities. Over the next four years, Africa CDC and UNICEF will work together to establish robust institutional backing for supply chain management and enhance pooled procurement mechanisms to fortify Africa’s healthcare infrastructure, ensuring timely and adequate access to essential medical supplies for its population.\nH.E Jean Kaseya expressed his pride in the partnership with UNICEF, stating that their shared commitments will enhance primary healthcare and strengthen Africa’s health security. ‘‘The partnership will optimise supply chain management, operationalise the pool procurement mechanism for Africa CDC, empower community health workers, and advance local manufacturing. Ultimately, these efforts will strengthen immunisation systems and reduce outbreaks and epidemics on the continent’’, he says.\nImmunisation is one of the most effective public health interventions globally. However, millions of children in Africa are still deprived of life-saving vaccinations.\nUNICEF’s The State of the World’s Children\n2023: For Every Child\n, Vaccination report revealed that 12.7 million children were under-vaccinated in 2021, including 8.7 million who did not receive a single dose, also called “zero-dose” children.\n“This partnership is a commitment to the well-being of children and their families, affirming their right to health. By strengthening our partnership with Africa CDC and the Joint Emergency Action Plan for Africa, we can ensure communities get the support they need without delay,” said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations. “The push forward on paid and protected community health workers, medical supplies made in Africa, for Africans, remains one of our highest priorities.”\nDuring the past two years, UNICEF and Africa CDC have achieved significant milestones in strengthening Africa CDC’s institutional capacity and catalysing community health programmes, immunisation systems, emergency response, and supply chain enhancement. Collaborative efforts secured the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses and essential cold chain equipment for routine immunisation. Joint high-level advocacy initiatives focused on immunisation, community health, and response to public health emergencies.\nAfrica imports 99% of its vaccines and 70 to 90% of its medicines and medical devices, which is a significant challenge. Africa CDC aims to achieve sustainable production and supply of essential health commodities through African manufacturers, considered Africa’s second independence by Africa CDC. Africa CDC’s goal is to work with African Union Member States and partners to actively advocate for and support the procurement of vaccines made in Africa and prioritise initiatives that strengthen local manufacturing.\nThrough the Partnership for Vaccine Manufacturing, Africa CDC aims to manufacture 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs by 2040, paving the way toward robust and self-reliant health systems, ensuring that people can obtain and use health commodities when and where required.\nThe expanded partnership between Africa CDC and UNICEF signifies a concerted effort to address Africa’s pressing health challenges. By prioritising immunisation, strengthening health systems, and promoting local production, both organisations are poised to make tangible and sustainable impacts on the health and well-being of children and communities across the continent while safeguarding Africa’s health security.\n#  #\nAbout the Partnership\nThe Africa CDC and UNICEF Partnership Framework Agreement, commenced in 2022 and extended today to 2027, contributes to the goals and objective of Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership framework outlines three programmatic areas of collaboration: (i) public health emergency preparedness and response; (ii) immunization systems strengthening; and (iii) procurement and supply chain systems strengthening. Under the partnership extension, this collaboration will expand, particularly in the areas of system strengthening for primary health care (including community health and nutrition systems), in supply chain management, regional and pooled procurement, manufacturing and emergency preparedness and response.\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

To tackle these challenges, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are pleased to announce the launch of a Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP). This pioneering five-year strategic collaboration will boost emergency preparedness and response efforts throughout Africa and thus ensure disease outbreaks during humanitarian crises and otherwise are managed efficiently.\nThe JEAP underlines the shared vision of Africa’s two leading public health institutions – to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent. The plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives while capitalising on the Africa CDC and WHO’s unique capabilities and resources. Aligned with the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order, WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030), and WHO EMRO’s four-year strategy for the Eastern Mediterranean region to address health emergencies – the JEAP strengthens emergency preparedness and response across six critical areas.\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health. JEAP will bolster our collective efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with the Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nPriority areas of action are strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection; stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations (70% of response activities during emergencies relate to such supply chain measures); and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. Most critically, this ground-breaking collaboration outlines impactful initiatives to be implemented in unison with countries to enhance the continent’s capacity to detect, monitor, and respond swiftly to health emergencies. In a first-of-its kind collaboration, the JEAP serves as a guiding beacon for targeted emergency response interventions and embodies the importance of cross-cutting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and resource mobilisation.\n“Africa CDC is proud to partner for this important continental strategic plan. Joining forces with WHO will significantly improve our ability to safeguard the health of African populations during times of crisis. Together, we will build resilient health systems and ensure a coordinated and effective response to emergencies across the continent,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC.\nIn an inspiring take, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean reiterated, “This visionary collaboration will breathe new life into the efficiency of current coordination mechanisms, strengthen institutions, and ultimately help us deliver quality healthcare services to our communities.”\nThese efforts are galvanising the commitments from governments, health agencies, and stakeholders to strengthen health emergency preparedness, detection, and response efforts. Through collective action and unwavering commitment, we will build resilient systems, enhance capacities, and safeguard the well-being of our communities. This partnership is a testament to our unwavering dedication to a healthier, safer Africa.\nPopular Tags\nWe are thrilled to announce the success of our recent AHRO webinar\nLatest Posts\n£25 Million Multi Clinical Trials Centers established by AHRO Network\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Starts identification of small molecules for some priority pathogens\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Institute to Add Undergraduate Courses to Its Portfolio\nDecember 27, 2024\nAHRO Appoints Five Ambassadors\nDecember 23, 2024\nAHRO Launches “Climate Change and One Health Project”\nDecember 19, 2024\nDr. Aasma Siddiqui Joins AHRO for 6-Month Fellowship\nDecember 19, 2024\nAHRO Courses to Officially Commence in January 2025\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Clinical Research Program Officially Launched\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO joins the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Confer Doctorate Degree to Hajia Hajara Shardow and Barbara Ngomo\nDecember 14, 2024\nAfrica Consultative Summit on Climate Change and One Health Organized by AHRO Center for Academic Research (UK)\nOctober 12, 2024\nPoverty Alleviation in Africa: The Way Forward – A Must-Watch Interview with Princess Nana Yakubu\nSeptember 6, 2024\nAHRO Commences Fellowship program, first cohort in 2025\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO opens five representative offices in West Africa\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Dubai to lead the product development program\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Canada to oversee commercialization and IP activities\nJune 13, 2024\n“AHRO will become one of the leaders in small drug molecules research”- Prof Yaro\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO appoints new Scientific Advisory Board\nJune 13, 2024\n“We are ready”- Dr Christine Nyirahabimana\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO starts its exploratory research activities\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO Starts electing Emeritus Fellows\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO Initiates a behaviour research on Obesity in Glasgow, Scotland\nJuly 14, 2023\nAHRO Courses – Principles of Ethics in Social Care: Equality, Diversity, Privacy, and Dignity\nJuly 12, 2023\nEmbracing Innovation: Exploring the Design of Umbrella and Basket Trials\nJune 29, 2023\nAHRO Visiting Scholars and Visiting Students Program: Apply Now\nJune 28, 2023\nLaunch of a New Partnership between WHO International Classification of Diseases and MedDRA\nJune 27, 2023\nAfrica Health Research Organisation (AHRO) Announces Resumption of Scientific Publishing, Unveiling Three Exciting Journals\nJune 13, 2023\nAfrica CDC and WHO Launch Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to Strengthen Health Systems and Combat Disease Outbreaks in Africa\nJune 5, 2023\nAHRO University Introduces Nursing and Midwifery Courses to Address Global Healthcare Needs\nMay 16, 2023\nMoving Beyond the Initial Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Africa\nMay 11, 2023\nX\n×\nYou must be logged in before using WishList.

These initiatives, co-funded by the European Union, are poised to fortify the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative (Africa PGI 2.0), enhancing the capacity of member states for molecular detection of outbreaks, AMR genomic surveillance, and timely data sharing across Africa.\nThe kick-off meeting, convened at the Africa CDC Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, signified a pivotal moment in the collaboration between the African CDC and the European Commission Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen outbreak detection and disease surveillance throughout Africa.\nThrough these projects implemented by the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HaDEA), Africa CDC, and HERA, in partnership with African Union (AU) Member States, the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) and the Africa Public Health Foundation (APHF), will strengthen national and regional capacities to promptly detect outbreaks, support the integration of AMR genomic surveillance, and facilitate swift and high-quality data sharing for public health decision-making.\nHis Excellency Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC, emphasized the significance of this partnership stating, “The increasing number of outbreaks is driven by complex ecological, climatic, political, economic, and social factors, all of which are becoming more exacerbated on our continent. These projects are poised to strengthen laboratory detection and surveillance of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic diseases, as well as antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Africa. They also highlight the strategic partnership between Africa CDC and the European Commission.”\nLaurent Muschel, Acting Director General of HERA, emphasized, “In the face of ongoing global health challenges, Africa CDC and HERA are taking together concrete actions to strengthen detection of outbreaks, AMR genomic surveillance, and timely data sharing across Africa. Fortifying multi-pathogen molecular detection and sequencing capabilities in the African Union is essential for global health security.”\nAfrica CDC’s shift towards Africa PGI 2.0 signifies a transition from emergency response to building an optimized, resilient, and integrated molecular diagnostic and genomic surveillance ecosystem. It is critical and timely to incorporate lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, and empower national and regional reference laboratories to expand their capabilities to detect and characterize epidemic and pandemic-prone diseases. As demonstrated in previous outbreaks, molecular detection and genomic sequencing improves early detection and response to public health emergencies. Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, CEO of ASLM, remarked, “The launch of the two projects is pivotal in devising scalable and sustainable approaches for integrating molecular diagnostics and sequencing within Africa’s routine surveillance structures. We are eager to collaborate with the Africa CDC and HERA to strengthen laboratory systems ensuring effective responses to current and future health threats”.\n“APHF will continue to strengthen collaboration with the Africa CDC and HERA to support the flagship Pathogen Genomics Initiative (Africa PGI) and advance public health laboratory systems for pandemic preparedness and response.” Said Dr. Ebere Okereke, CEO of APHF\nThe Africa CDC is working with ASLM, APHF, Member States, the Africa Laboratory Technical Working Group, and other partners to ensure the effective and successful implementation of the two projects.\n# #\nFor more information:\nDr. Sofonias Tessema, Program Lead, Africa PGI |Africa CDC| sofoniast@africacdc.org\nMedia inquiries:\nMs. Margaret Muigai Edwin,\nDirector, Communication & Public Information Directorate: Africa CDC |\nTel: +255 742 635 592 | Email:\nedwinm@africacdc.org\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is the continental autonomous Health agency of the African Union that strengthens the capacity and capability of Africa’s public health institutions as well as partnerships to detect and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats and outbreaks, based on data-driven interventions and programmes.

However, important changes in health needs, financing and governance necessitate a renewed vision for how they support countries to deliver sustainable impact.\n“With the growing need for strong and resilient health systems that can adapt to emerging threats, while continuing to meet existing health needs, the imperative of optimizing the impact of available resources is becoming increasingly urgent to advance Africa towards universal health coverage,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s Regional Director for Africa.\nFocusing on GHIs as an entry point and catalyst for change in the broader health financing ecosystem, the\nLusaka Agenda\n, published on UHC Day on 12 December 2023, represented the culmination of a 14-month, multi-stakeholder process that captured consensus around five strategic shifts for the long-term evolution of GHIs. The roadmap for the implementation of the Lusaka Agenda implementation in Africa will set out priority actions to realize these shifts.\n“At the 37th African Union (summit in February, African leaders endorsed the establishment of an accountability mechanism within the AU architecture to ensure effective implementation of the Lusaka Agenda on the continent. Our discussions over the past two days began to give shape to what this might look like,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC.\nThe draft roadmap will be refined over the coming months, before it is presented for consideration by  ministers of health at the WHO Regional Committee for Africa, to be held in Brazzaville, Congo, in August this year.\n“The Lusaka Agenda will ensure long-term sustainability and will propel countries towards achieving UHC,” said Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, and co-chair of the Lusaka Agenda Working Group.\nTo deliver more sustainable impact in the face of emerging threats such as climate change and conflicts, the key shifts highlighted in the Lusaka Agenda include a  focus on strengthening primary health care by bolstering health systems, catalysing action on domestic financing,  improving joint approaches to achieving health equity, and strategic and operational coherence among  GHIs. The Lusaka Agenda  also calls for  improved  coordination of approaches to products, reseach and development (R&D) and regional manufacturing, to address market and policy failures in global health.\n“The Lusaka Agenda is now moving from talk to action, led by countries, and GHIs are listening,” added Linda Mafu, the Global Fund’s head of Civil Society and Political Advocacy.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)",

These eight products require purchasers to remain commercially viable beyond their country’s domestic demand.\n“Across the spectrum of requirements for the near-to-market products, predictable demand is the central challenge faced by manufacturers,” the meeting heard.\nAfrica is confronted with limited demand for homegrown vaccine offers, fragmented markets, and poor economies of scale that limit the business case for local manufacturers to invest in vaccine manufacturing facilities and other health product technologies.\nThe ministers suggested fast-track regulatory harmonization to push the wide distribution of medicines and to assure quality. There is a need to strengthen national regulatory authorities and domesticate the\nAU model law at the national level\n.\nThe AU Summit in 2024 decided the establishment of the African Pooled Procurement Mechanism (APPM) as a solution. APPM aims to improve access to quality and affordable health products and promote the localization of manufacturing led by the Africa CDC.\nDuring the briefing, the AU Member states pledged to support the continental ambition, avoid competition amongst member states, and strengthen the regional mechanism to ensure the continent can manufacture the vaccines and other health products it needs. It was reiterated that the African Medicines Agency (AMA) requires member states’ collective support to obtain affordable quality medicines.\nThe meeting allowed partners to share their responses in support of the local manufacturing agenda on the continent. The Africa CDC will pursue critical interventions in vaccine manufacturing to be on course to achieve the ambition of manufacturing 60% of vaccines needed by 2040.

Low health investment and limited prioritization of the health workforce have critically exposed health systems. Investment in health, especially from domestic sources, is still low and inadequate for many countries to meet the universal health coverage and ensure health security\n“The numbers of Africans who have left the continent in search of greener pastures in other parts of the world are staggering. It is a matter that needs to be addressed as a top priority for African governments and indeed all those who wish to see a shift in the historical as well as current trends,” said Honourable Dr Kalumbi Shangula, Minister of Health and Social Services of Namibia.\nThe charter launched today brought together the health workforce investment efforts of all stakeholders, including national governments, the private health sector, civil society, external financing institutions and development partners in Africa.\n“By investing in the health workforce, we not only address the challenges within the sector but also generate dividends in education, employment and gender equality,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “These investments will contribute to our sustained efforts in attracting more resources and improving the quality of our health workforce.”\nInvesting in the health workforce will have positive spin-offs in the form of decent jobs, particularly for women and youth who often face barriers to employment. By providing opportunities for education, training and career progression, the Charter will immensely contribute to the economic empowerment of these demographics and fundamentally support inclusive economic growth.\nAdditionally, health labour force investment also brings multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage.\nFor every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, and that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%.\n“Studies show that investments in the health sector yield substantial economic returns, estimating a nine-to-one return on investment. The new narrative that we are promoting is to transform the health sector to move from liability to an asset for the economy of our countries,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter was inaugurated in Namibia during the Health Workforce Investment Forum being held from 6 to 8 May 2024. Efforts will continue to be made to engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)",

The planned Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) was announced during the Mpox in Africa—High-Level Emergency Regional Meeting, held in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 11 to 13 April. “We propose the establishment of an African-led multi-disciplinary, multicountry Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa with the overarching goal of establishing a research network to advance the elimination of mpox,” Jean B. Nachega (Professor Extraordinary of Medicine Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases Stellenbosch University Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences) told the meeting.\nMpox is endemic to 12 countries in Africa\nNachega said Africa has faced a long-standing unmet need for sustainable local diagnostic laboratories and research capacity for mpox.\n“MpoxReC will address these needs and provide outcome monitoring and surveillance across endemic African countries while simultaneously contributing to much-needed South-South, multi-disciplinary, and inter-professional research collaborations and capacity-building,” he said. He said the continent needs to share national and regional epidemic preparedness frameworks on the disease.\nThe research group, which includes global partners and African collaborators, will initially focus on Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, and the Republic of Congo.  Professor Nadia Sam-Agudu will lead researchers at the University of Cape Coast Ghana, Professor Samuel Nakoune Yandoko will head the team at Pasteur Institute in Bangui, the Central African Republic, co-principal investigators Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe and Professor Placide Mbala will represent the DRC’s Institute National Research Biomedical, Professor Dimie Ogoina from Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital will represent Nigeria, Cameroon’s Pasteur Institute research team will be led by Professor Richard Njouom and Congo will be led by Professor Francine Ntoumi from the Congolese Foundation for Medical Research. Expansion to other African countries will take place later.\n28 April 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nDiseases\nMpox\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "content": "Antimicrobial Resistance is a Greater Threat than HIV-AIDS, TB and Malaria, Says New Report – Africa CDC\nSkip to content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nPress Releases\nAntimicrobial Resistance is a Greater Threat than HIV-AIDS, TB and Malaria, Says New Report\nADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, August 15\n– The likelihood of falling ill or dying from diseases that resist treatment has escalated in Africa, with children and other vulnerable groups being most at risk, according to a new report by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).\n“The continent faces the highest mortality rate from antimicrobial resistance (AMR), with 27.3 deaths per 100,000—exceeding the combined death toll from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria,” said the ‘African Union Landmark Report’ launched today at Africa CDC headquarters.\nAfrica bears a significant burden of infectious diseases, accounting for approximately 95% of malaria deaths, 70% of people living with HIV, and 25% of TB deaths globally, said the report.\n“We must not ignore this silent threat that disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable among us,” said Africa CDC Deputy Director General, Dr Raji Tajudeen.\nAMR occurs when microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites develop resistance to antimicrobial drugs, a process hastened by human behaviors such as the misuse and overuse of these drugs in healthcare, agriculture and food systems. This renders antibiotics and other antimicrobials less effective, causing treatment failures, increased disease spread, severe illness, disability and higher mortality rates.\nDespite the estimated USD2-6 billion needed annually for an effective AMR response across Africa, current funding is only a tenth of that allocated to other major diseases. This underfunding makes AMR a significant barrier to sustainable development, hindering progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.\nAn estimated 700,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections globally. Without timely intervention, this number is projected to reach 10 million by 2050, with Africa accounting for 4.5 million.\n“Fighting disease requires resources and working with member states and our partners we need to do all we can to save lives,” said Dr Tajudeen, speaking at the launch of a report on AMR in Africa. The event also initiated discussions on a roadmap and targets to advance Africa’s battle against AMR. The outcomes are expected to inform the upcoming United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting in September—a crucial platform for global action on this escalating crisis.\nDr Huyam Salih, the director of the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), emphasized the critical role that the AU must play in combating AMR. “Antimicrobial resistance is not just a health issue—it is a threat to our agrifood systems, food safety, food security, livelihoods, and economies,” she said.\nBy 2050, global healthcare costs could exceed USD1 trillion per year, and livestock production could decline by 2.6% to 7.5% annually due to AMR, according to Dr Salih. “In Africa, the situation is particularly alarming, with 37 countries reporting the prevalence of AMR in animal farms, yet only 16% of African countries are conducting routine AMR surveillance in animals as of 2023,” she said.\nDr Salih also called for urgent action to strengthen leadership, expand surveillance and data systems, promote the responsible use of antimicrobials, improve public and animal health systems, and secure sustainable financing to combat AMR effectively. “Our health, our food, and our future depend on the actions we take now,” she stressed.\nDr Tajudeen said addressing AMR in Africa requires engaging all levels of society in a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. “Unless we work together, overcoming antimicrobial resistance will be a difficult and long-drawn process that will cost lives,” he said.\nCurrently, millions in Africa lack access to essential antibiotics, with a study by Africa CDC and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine revealing that only 1.3% of microbiology labs in 14 member states can test for key AMR pathogens.\nThe head of the African Society for Laboratory Medicine, Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, reaffirmed the organization’s commitment to strengthening African laboratory capacities to combat antimicrobial resistance. “Our goal is to ensure the continued efficacy of treatments and promote data-driven solutions to safeguard public health across the continent,” he said.\nDr Tajudeen underscored the importance of prioritizing infection prevention, strengthening health and food systems, developing human resources, ensuring sustainable access to diagnostics and therapeutics, and investing in laboratory infrastructure for effective surveillance and data generation.\nThe report recommends an increase in the availability of high-quality diagnostics, vaccines, and antimicrobials for high-priority pathogens in high-risk African countries.\nFor more information\n:\nMedia inquiries:\nMargaret Edwin,\nDirector of Communication & Public Information Division: Africa CDC | Tel: +251 986 632 878 | Email:\nEdwinM@africacdc.org\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

    "content": "Enhancing Vaccine Storage Efficiencies in Africa – Africa CDC\nSkip to content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nPress Releases\nEnhancing Vaccine Storage Efficiencies in Africa\n8 February 2024,\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), in collaboration with the Mastercard Foundation under the Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative, has provided state-of-the-art cold chain equipment to five (5) African Union Member States.  These Member States are Botswana, Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zambia, are part of the initial delivery targeting a total of 32 Member States in the phase one investment for the procurement of Cold Chain Equipment (CCE). The equipment was procured and delivered through the support of UNICEF, one of the initiative’s implementing partners. The support aligns with the Africa CDC goal of strengthening healthcare systems and enhancing the response to vaccine-preventable diseases.\nThe cumulative equipment across the five (5) Member States, which consists of 465 refrigerators and freezers, 1,150 temperature monitors, 5,253 vaccine carriers and cold boxes, and 2 cold rooms, all valued up to USD 3.3 million, will significantly enhance the healthcare infrastructure and capabilities. The equipment is designed to efficiently manage vaccines and vital medical supplies, supporting the expansion of COVID-19 vaccination and other programs, including routine Immunization, which aims to ensure safe and effective vaccines reach every child. By expanding the cold chain storage capacity, the Ministries of Health will be able to offer a more comprehensive vaccination program and improve vaccine coverage rates.\nH.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, the Africa CDC Director General, emphasizes the significant benefits of this equipment in minimizing vaccine wastage due to temperature fluctuations. “This optimization allows the Ministries of Health to allocate healthcare budgets more effectively and allocate resources to other critical areas of healthcare. The availability of CCE facilitates extensive immunization activities, reaching remote and underserved communities. This, in turn, leads to improved vaccine coverage rates, reducing the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases, including COVID-19, and strengthening health security in Africa towards attaining global health security,” Dr Kaseya said.\nThe provision of Cold Chain Equipment is crucial in preserving vaccines and maintaining the efficacy of temperature-sensitive medical supplies. The addition of freezers and refrigerators enables member states to store a wider range of vaccines, including those requiring ultra-low temperatures like COVID-19. This expansion of cold chain storage is essential to pandemic preparedness and will enable member states to offer more comprehensive vaccination programs.\nThe cold boxes and vaccine carriers provide reliable transportation while maintaining the recommended vaccine temperature, ensuring vaccine efficacy and safety. This feature increases geographic coverage and contributes to improved immunization service delivery and health security in Africa by enhancing the capacity of Ministries of Health to manage vaccines and strengthen their cold chain systems.\nDuring the handover ceremony in Zambia, the Honorable Sylvia Masebo, the Minister of Health of the Republic of Zambia, highlighted that the support from Afric a CDC aligns with Zambia’s goals to have readily available life-saving vaccines and strengthened cold chain capacity, and the Ministry will seek more equipment to build on the gains made, while implementing the integration of COVID-19 vaccines into primary healthcare services.\nThe Africa CDC, Mastercard Foundation, and UNICEF anticipate the successful installation and efficient use of these CCEs in healthcare facilities, positively catalyzing and strengthening the healthcare landscape in the Member States. With this support, the Ministries of Health are better positioned to respond effectively to public health emergencies, ensuring equitable access to vaccines and treatments. The support provided by the Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation demonstrates their commitment to strengthening healthcare systems in Africa. It underscores the importance of collective collaboration in addressing global health challenges and ensuring vaccine equity for Africa.\nFor more information:\nDr Merawi Aragaw| Head of Division for Surveillance and Disease Intelligence | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: merawia@africa-union.org| M: +251912611294 Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nFor media inquiry:\nFor media enquiries please contact:\nDorothy Njagi\n| Senior Communication Officer- Communication & Public Information directorate | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: email:\nnjagid@africacdc.org\n| Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous Public Health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

This independent body serves as the principal advisory group to WHO AFRO for strategic guidance on all matters pertaining to public health emergency preparedness and response.\nThe EPR Technical Advisory Group will play a critical role in supporting WHO African Member States to fortify health security in the face of diverse emergencies. Countries in the WHO African Region experience over 100 health emergencies annually which disrupt the economy and prosperity of communities and weaken already fragile health systems. With climate change and conflict aggravating more than half of Africa’s health emergencies, the next pandemic is not just a possibility, it's imminent. It is imperative, now more than ever, to enhance the Emergency Preparedness and Response capabilities within the Region.\nComposed of 16 distinguished experts (details below) from diverse fields like epidemiology, public health, global health, vaccinology, paediatrics, nutrition, internal medicine, infectious diseases, programme management, health-care administration, health economics, health communication, sociology, the EPR-TAG advises the WHO AFRO Regional Director on key issues. These include assessing the regional context of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies; conducting horizon scanning for new and emerging threats; providing strategic guidance on preparedness, response, and recovery strategies; reviewing progress in implementing regional health security initiatives; and strengthening country ownership and decision-making in emergency response.\nThe EPR-TAG is chaired by Dr Deo Nshimirimana, a retired WHO medical doctor renowned for his expertise in immunization in emergency settings. Assisting him is Dr Rebecca Martin, Vice President of Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute, appointed as the Vice-Chairperson. Dr Martin brings decades of experience in health security, emergency response and immunization. Both leaders bring a wealth of experience in public health and will guide the EPR-TAG for an initial three-year term. \"The opportunity to lead the EPR-TAG is a great honour, and I am thrilled to be part of this transformative team.

The AU delegation was led by the AUC, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD). The EU delegation was led by the Belgian Presidency of the European Council and the European Commission.\nBuilding on the health commitments of the 6th EU-AU Summit and outcomes of the Addis Ababa AU-EU High-level dialogue, the AU and EU expanded collaboration in priority areas of common interest in the New Public Health Order and the EU Global Health Strategy, such as strengthening pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health, AMR, digital health, climate and health. This collaboration is a positive example of the AU-EU partnership to support global health in multilateral fora. Enhancing equitable access to safe, qualitive, effective and affordable health services and products and national sovereignty will be key to reach SDG-targets such as achieving Universal Health Coverage. Therefore, it is crucial to support social protection systems which incorporate social health protection, aiming at gradually granting universal health coverage as well as at providing income security in case of sickness. The AU and EU further stressed the importance of the health sector in the creation of jobs and growth. They also expressed their commitment to conclude negotiations on a pandemic agreement and International Health Regulations by the May 2024 World Health Assembly.\nMost African countries are struggling to ensure sustainable and equitable access to the health products needed to meet the continent’s priority health needs. At the same time, the EU has expertise in health as well as manufacturing and access, including regulation of health products and has set out clear targets in supporting human development in its international partnerships.\nWith this High-level conference, the EU engages in continued technical collaboration on health in Africa and investments in strengthening Africa’s health security architecture. The EU’s Global Gateway strategy will be key to deliver on these commitments, notably through Team Europe Initiatives, increasing the resilience of European and African health systems in response to the rapidly shifting health burden, social protection, the impact of climate change and emerging health threats while considering innovative science, sharing of technical expertise and knowledge (as well as multi-stakeholder commitments).\nThe Belgian Presidency and the European Commission will follow up on the high-level conference in the European Council and in the governing bodies of the EU’s international cooperation instruments, aligned with shared interests and ambitions of European and African partners.\nAfrican Union Commissioner for Health, Humanitarian Affairs and Social Development,\nH.E. Amb. Minata Samate Cessouma\n“\nThe establishment of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) marks a crucial step forward in safeguarding health security on the continent by ensuring the availability and the accessibility of quality pharmaceutical products. This availability and accessibility facilitate prevention strategies and rapid responses to health emergencies, strengthening regulatory capacities and promoting regional cooperation and harmonisation of standards. By harmonising regulatory processes and promoting access to effectual medical products, the AMA can significantly enhance public health outcomes and promote sustainable development in Africa, as envisioned in the Africa Health Strategy (2016-2030) and the African Union Agenda 2063. AMA is also envisioned to bolster research and development efforts within the continent, fostering innovation and self-reliance in addressing health challenges specific to the continent. Looking to the future, the African Union Commission is enthusiastic about knowledge-sharing between the European Union and Africa to leverage the experience of establishing the European Mediines Agency to chart guidance and regulatory pathways for the development and approval of new manufacturing technologies and processes.\nBelgian Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities,\nH.E. Caroline GENNEZ\n“\nThe EU and Africa express a shared vision of health as the precondition for social development. African countries have extensive experience in the containment of epidemics; European countries have some of the best and most accessible healthcare in the world. Global health is an area in which the EU offers added value as a partner to Africa based on its expertise and experience. Europe bolsters its international partnerships by focusing on its unique selling proposition. Our cooperation on this front will improve health outcomes for countless of people, in Africa and Europe. Our focus will be on building affordable, available and high-quality healthcare systems.\n”\nEuropean Commissioner for International Partnerships,\nH.E. Jutta URPILAINEN\n“\nLearning the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, the AU and the EU are committed to advance health systems and strengthen health capacities globally. This joint commitment was well reflected in the Global Gateway investment package, which we presented at the AU-EU Summit of 2022. We are proud of the results achieved in increasing local manufacturing of medicines and vaccines in Africa, for Africa. Today we launch three major Team Europe Initiatives on health security, digital health and public health institutes, and strengthen cooperation between our institutions. This is another step forward to better confront evolving health challenges and to enhance the resilience of our communities.\n”\nEuropean Commissioner for Health and Food Safety,\nH.E. Stella KYRIAKIDES\n“\nAn ever-closer partnership between the African Union and the European Union is indispensable for public health. We want to work more closely with our African partners on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health and anti-microbial resistance, as well as the health effects of climate change. These are core objectives for our EU Global Health Strategy and the foundations of our cooperation with the African continent. We are now at a critical stage of the negotiations on the pandemic agreement and the international health regulations, with which we would provide new multilateral solutions to common challenges. The EU is committed to conclude the negotiations by May, a responsibility equally shared by all nations. I am pleased that the African Union and EU are joining voices and taking concrete steps to support global health internationally.\n”\nAfrica CDC Director General,\nH.E Dr Jean Kaseya\n“As we navigate the complexities of global health, Africa is on the path towards self-sufficiency through equitable access to medical products. Africa’s target of producing 60% of vaccines by 2040 through the Africa CDC underscores our commitment to health sovereignty. Through strategic partnerships like the EU-AU collaboration, we accelerate our capabilities, leveraging expertise and resources to build resilient health systems and strengthen Pandemic preparedness.”\nSpecific outcomes of the high-level conference include the following concrete engagements:\nWorking Arrangement between Africa CDC and the European Commission to best implement the expanded strategic AU-EU Health partnership;\nThe European Commission and the Belgian Presidency announced additional TEI MAV+ funding for the advancement of the African Medicines Agency;\nThe announcement of procurement commitments by Global Health Initiatives to buy in Africa for Africa;\nThree additional Team Europe Initiatives on health were launched: Health Security using a One Health approach, Digital Health, and Public Health Institutes;\nThe Team Europe Initiative (TEI) on Social Protection was launched;\nWork product leads for Team Europe and Team Africa were confirmed;\nA new programme ‘SafeBirth Africa’ to support improved access to innovative life-saving commodities for sexual and reproductive health in Africa.

African leaders pledge to increase the share of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics locally manufactured in Africa to 60% by 2040. This vision will be achieved by establishing a sustainable vaccine development and manufacturing ecosystem underpinned by research and development, intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer, robust regulatory systems, innovative and sustainable financing, strategic partnerships, and commitment by African and global procurement agencies to purchase vaccines produced on the continent.\nSince the late 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided a safety, quality, and efficacy assurance assessment process, now known as “WHO prequalification” (PQ), to ensure vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and other health products supplied by procurement agencies meet acceptable standards and to facilitate the regulatory review and uptake of health products in Iow-resource settings.\nIn Africa, the slow process of WHO PQ was seen as one of the key limitations on the way to achieving the local manufacturing agenda. In this context, Africa CDC welcomes the new\nWHO policy\nto initiate parallel processes both for recommendation guidelines and PQ or Emergency Use Listing Procedure (EUL) assessment as an important step in addressing the inequity in rapidly accessing essential and innovative health products. The use of interim guidelines, especially for innovator products, will be useful in accelerating timelines. Nevertheless, they require significant efforts to address the high data and evidence standards, know how to produce a complete dossier for submission and interact with PQ’s consultation processes.\nOne of the critical and intrinsic factors for sustainable manufacturing in Africa is ensuring that African manufacturers have access to efficient and harmonized regulatory pathways that ensure high-quality products and market access for African-made products. The acquisition of maturity level 3 (ML3) status in five (5) African countries, coupled with ongoing competency programs through Regional Centres for Regulatory Excellence (RCOREs), underscores the critical importance for African regulatory experts to possess expertise and capabilities that align with adequate regulatory oversight across the entire lifecycle of vaccine production.\nLengthy and fragmented processes to acquire regulatory approval will lead to late market access and financial and administrative burdens for African manufacturers. In addressing this,\nachieving WHO prequalification to enter the United Nations (UN) procurement system\nis particularly important for African manufacturers to reach the economics of scales necessary to foster a conducive manufacturing eco-system, including Research and Development. We encourage WHO to continue to support the strengthening of these important activities and engagement and communication across diverse stakeholder communities. Africa CDC will continue to monitor the progress and execution of these and similar recommendations for the benefits of local manufacturing of pharmaceutical products in Africa.\n3 April 2024\nTheme\nRespectful Partnership\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

CEPI stands ready to support Africa CDC in the realisation of these goals and to further strengthen Africa’s preparedness and resilience against future outbreaks.”\nIn line with the African Union’s (A.U.) ambition to produce 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs in Africa by 2040 under the Africa CDC’s Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM);  the expanded partnership will ultimately focus its efforts on enhancing research and development, building a workforce as well as supply chain optimization to support resilient health systems This ambition will increase vaccine sovereignty and reduce external reliance, helping prevent a recurrence of the vaccine inequity seen during the COVID-19 response in Africa.\nTo boost vaccine accessibility and efficiency and meet this goal, there is a need to invest in vaccine R&D and manufacturing innovations, amongst others, and build a resilient regional supply chain. To that end, Africa CDC and CEPI will coordinate to fund innovations accelerating speed, scale, or accessibility for initial implementation with African manufacturers. This investment will support sustainable manufacturing for routine vaccinations in Africa, and—in the event of an outbreak—these facilities can be mobilized to produce response vaccines promptly.\nIn alignment with Africa CDC, the partnership also aims to bolster Africa’s research ecosystem and clinical trial infrastructure, including targeted capacity strengthening through CEPI’s\nResearch Preparedness Program\n—which, directed by regional experts, aims to build capacity for conducting high-quality Phase 3 efficacy trials.\nBuilding on existing clinical trial capability in some African countries is vital as vaccine candidates against endemic diseases, such as\nLassa fever\n, progress into late-stage development. Phase 3 trials provide essential data required for vaccine approval and must take place in regions where the disease is prevalent. A\nCEPI-funded Phase 2 trial for a Lassa fever vaccine\ncandidate is already underway; it is crucial that if this candidate, or another, is successful, there is regional capability to further its path toward licensure. Once established, this capability can benefit other regional actors advancing to late-stage research.\nThe organizations will also collaborate to enhance vaccine safety protocols, biosecurity, pathogen surveillance, investment in capacity building, and other areas that help ensure overall African readiness for emergency vaccine responses.\nAfrica CDC and CEPI are committed to this cooperation, which will strengthen collaboration and deliver tangible results to deliver Africa’s long-term health security ambitions.\n—END\n—\nNotes to Editors\nAbout CEPI\nCEPI was launched in 2017 as an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civil organisations. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic disease threats and enable equitable access to them. CEPI has supported the development of more than 50 vaccine candidates or platform technologies against multiple known high-risk pathogens and is also advancing the development of rapid response platforms for vaccines against a future Disease X. Central to CEPI’s pandemic-beating five-year plan for 2022-2026 is the ‘100 Days Mission’ to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days.\nAbout Africa CDC\nAbout Africa CDC: The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

The Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative, a bold and unprecedented $1.5 billion partnership, was launched in June 2021. This innovative and ground-breaking partnership aimed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, roll out vaccinations, build the vaccine manufacturing workforce for the continent, and strengthen the Africa CDC to ensure long-term health security for Africa.\nUnprecedented in scale, speed and inclusion of African organisations, the partnership has\ncontributed to the continent’s current vaccination rate of 53 per cent of\nthe target population, up from just 3 per cent at the start of the initiative. The partnership has also trained, equipped, and deployed 38,000 health workers, creating a robust frontline in safeguarding public health locally. It has provided job opportunities for 23,000 individuals and integrated over 600 COVID-19 vaccination centres into healthcare systems. Additionally, this initiative led to the expansion of genomic testing capabilities from seven to 40 laboratories across the continent.\nThe review of Phase 1 of this initiative, among fifteen implementing partners across 29 countries, conducted by Deloitte, indicates that the vast majority of funds disbursed were used effectively and as intended. Likewise, ongoing monitoring by KPMG has confirmed that partners not only showed strength in programmatic results but also improved the institutional capacity for greater sustainability and institutional resilience.\n“Our Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative with the Mastercard Foundation has shown the power of respectful and action-oriented partnerships rooted in collaboration, coordination and systems strengthening. The experience and learnings from Phase I will enable us to move with greater speed and scale to deliver with accelerated impact to our member states” said\nDr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC\n.\nIn its second phase, the partnership will expand its scope and scale, focusing on completing the vaccination of healthcare workers and vulnerable groups, building a robust workforce of community health workers, ensuring pandemic preparedness by bolstering national public health institutions, laboratory capacities, data access and quality, local manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, and continuing strengthening of Africa CDC.\n“While the global pandemic may be declared over, the need to continue investing in our health systems, build our workforce and prepare for future pandemics remains urgent. This partnership will ensure that we have strong health institutions and systems. We aim to enable thousands of young people to build their careers in healthcare and contribute to improving lives in Africa,” said\nReeta Roy, President, and CEO of the Mastercard Foundation.\nThe Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative stands out as a testament to the power of African-led health solutions. As it progresses to its next phase, partnerships will continue to play a crucial role in shaping a New Public Health Order for Africa.

The collaboration builds on the 2022-2024 Partnership Framework Agreement between Africa CDC and UNICEF, which aims to achieve the goals outlined in the African Union Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership is expected to have a significant impact on public health in Africa by strengthening procurement and supply chain systems, with a particular focus on immunisation for children across the continent.\nH.E Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of Africa CDC, and Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations, signed the expanded partnership agreement in Addis Ababa.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of many healthcare systems and highlighted deficiencies and challenges in medical supply chains. While countries with strong primary healthcare systems were better able to cope, the disruption caused by the pandemic left others facing shortages of vital medical commodities. Over the next four years, Africa CDC and UNICEF will work together to establish robust institutional backing for supply chain management and enhance pooled procurement mechanisms to fortify Africa’s healthcare infrastructure, ensuring timely and adequate access to essential medical supplies for its population.\nH.E Jean Kaseya expressed his pride in the partnership with UNICEF, stating that their shared commitments will enhance primary healthcare and strengthen Africa’s health security. ‘‘The partnership will optimise supply chain management, operationalise the pool procurement mechanism for Africa CDC, empower community health workers, and advance local manufacturing. Ultimately, these efforts will strengthen immunisation systems and reduce outbreaks and epidemics on the continent’’, he says.\nImmunisation is one of the most effective public health interventions globally. However, millions of children in Africa are still deprived of life-saving vaccinations.\nUNICEF’s The State of the World’s Children\n2023: For Every Child\n, Vaccination report revealed that 12.7 million children were under-vaccinated in 2021, including 8.7 million who did not receive a single dose, also called “zero-dose” children.\n“This partnership is a commitment to the well-being of children and their families, affirming their right to health. By strengthening our partnership with Africa CDC and the Joint Emergency Action Plan for Africa, we can ensure communities get the support they need without delay,” said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations. “The push forward on paid and protected community health workers, medical supplies made in Africa, for Africans, remains one of our highest priorities.”\nDuring the past two years, UNICEF and Africa CDC have achieved significant milestones in strengthening Africa CDC’s institutional capacity and catalysing community health programmes, immunisation systems, emergency response, and supply chain enhancement. Collaborative efforts secured the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses and essential cold chain equipment for routine immunisation. Joint high-level advocacy initiatives focused on immunisation, community health, and response to public health emergencies.\nAfrica imports 99% of its vaccines and 70 to 90% of its medicines and medical devices, which is a significant challenge. Africa CDC aims to achieve sustainable production and supply of essential health commodities through African manufacturers, considered Africa’s second independence by Africa CDC. Africa CDC’s goal is to work with African Union Member States and partners to actively advocate for and support the procurement of vaccines made in Africa and prioritise initiatives that strengthen local manufacturing.\nThrough the Partnership for Vaccine Manufacturing, Africa CDC aims to manufacture 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs by 2040, paving the way toward robust and self-reliant health systems, ensuring that people can obtain and use health commodities when and where required.\nThe expanded partnership between Africa CDC and UNICEF signifies a concerted effort to address Africa’s pressing health challenges. By prioritising immunisation, strengthening health systems, and promoting local production, both organisations are poised to make tangible and sustainable impacts on the health and well-being of children and communities across the continent while safeguarding Africa’s health security.\n#  #\nAbout the Partnership\nThe Africa CDC and UNICEF Partnership Framework Agreement, commenced in 2022 and extended today to 2027, contributes to the goals and objective of Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership framework outlines three programmatic areas of collaboration: (i) public health emergency preparedness and response; (ii) immunization systems strengthening; and (iii) procurement and supply chain systems strengthening. Under the partnership extension, this collaboration will expand, particularly in the areas of system strengthening for primary health care (including community health and nutrition systems), in supply chain management, regional and pooled procurement, manufacturing and emergency preparedness and response.\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

To tackle these challenges, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are pleased to announce the launch of a Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP). This pioneering five-year strategic collaboration will boost emergency preparedness and response efforts throughout Africa and thus ensure disease outbreaks during humanitarian crises and otherwise are managed efficiently.\nThe JEAP underlines the shared vision of Africa’s two leading public health institutions – to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent. The plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives while capitalising on the Africa CDC and WHO’s unique capabilities and resources. Aligned with the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order, WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030), and WHO EMRO’s four-year strategy for the Eastern Mediterranean region to address health emergencies – the JEAP strengthens emergency preparedness and response across six critical areas.\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health. JEAP will bolster our collective efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with the Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nPriority areas of action are strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection; stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations (70% of response activities during emergencies relate to such supply chain measures); and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. Most critically, this ground-breaking collaboration outlines impactful initiatives to be implemented in unison with countries to enhance the continent’s capacity to detect, monitor, and respond swiftly to health emergencies. In a first-of-its kind collaboration, the JEAP serves as a guiding beacon for targeted emergency response interventions and embodies the importance of cross-cutting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and resource mobilisation.\n“Africa CDC is proud to partner for this important continental strategic plan. Joining forces with WHO will significantly improve our ability to safeguard the health of African populations during times of crisis. Together, we will build resilient health systems and ensure a coordinated and effective response to emergencies across the continent,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC.\nIn an inspiring take, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean reiterated, “This visionary collaboration will breathe new life into the efficiency of current coordination mechanisms, strengthen institutions, and ultimately help us deliver quality healthcare services to our communities.”\nThese efforts are galvanising the commitments from governments, health agencies, and stakeholders to strengthen health emergency preparedness, detection, and response efforts. Through collective action and unwavering commitment, we will build resilient systems, enhance capacities, and safeguard the well-being of our communities. This partnership is a testament to our unwavering dedication to a healthier, safer Africa.\nPopular Tags\nWe are thrilled to announce the success of our recent AHRO webinar\nLatest Posts\n£25 Million Multi Clinical Trials Centers established by AHRO Network\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Starts identification of small molecules for some priority pathogens\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Institute to Add Undergraduate Courses to Its Portfolio\nDecember 27, 2024\nAHRO Appoints Five Ambassadors\nDecember 23, 2024\nAHRO Launches “Climate Change and One Health Project”\nDecember 19, 2024\nDr. Aasma Siddiqui Joins AHRO for 6-Month Fellowship\nDecember 19, 2024\nAHRO Courses to Officially Commence in January 2025\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Clinical Research Program Officially Launched\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO joins the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Confer Doctorate Degree to Hajia Hajara Shardow and Barbara Ngomo\nDecember 14, 2024\nAfrica Consultative Summit on Climate Change and One Health Organized by AHRO Center for Academic Research (UK)\nOctober 12, 2024\nPoverty Alleviation in Africa: The Way Forward – A Must-Watch Interview with Princess Nana Yakubu\nSeptember 6, 2024\nAHRO Commences Fellowship program, first cohort in 2025\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO opens five representative offices in West Africa\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Dubai to lead the product development program\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Canada to oversee commercialization and IP activities\nJune 13, 2024\n“AHRO will become one of the leaders in small drug molecules research”- Prof Yaro\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO appoints new Scientific Advisory Board\nJune 13, 2024\n“We are ready”- Dr Christine Nyirahabimana\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO starts its exploratory research activities\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO Starts electing Emeritus Fellows\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO Initiates a behaviour research on Obesity in Glasgow, Scotland\nJuly 14, 2023\nAHRO Courses – Principles of Ethics in Social Care: Equality, Diversity, Privacy, and Dignity\nJuly 12, 2023\nEmbracing Innovation: Exploring the Design of Umbrella and Basket Trials\nJune 29, 2023\nAHRO Visiting Scholars and Visiting Students Program: Apply Now\nJune 28, 2023\nLaunch of a New Partnership between WHO International Classification of Diseases and MedDRA\nJune 27, 2023\nAfrica Health Research Organisation (AHRO) Announces Resumption of Scientific Publishing, Unveiling Three Exciting Journals\nJune 13, 2023\nAfrica CDC and WHO Launch Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to Strengthen Health Systems and Combat Disease Outbreaks in Africa\nJune 5, 2023\nAHRO University Introduces Nursing and Midwifery Courses to Address Global Healthcare Needs\nMay 16, 2023\nMoving Beyond the Initial Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Africa\nMay 11, 2023\nX\n×\nYou must be logged in before using WishList.

Such collaborative efforts are essential in building stronger health systems and ensuring a more secure future for all.\nWe also commend the allocation of up to £103.5 million for the development of affordable vaccines and health products, along with initiatives to combat the spread of infectious diseases, particularly during pandemics, as a demonstration of the United Kingdom’s leadership in the field of global health. This investment will undoubtedly contribute to safeguarding the health and well-being of populations worldwide, preventing future outbreaks, and ultimately saving lives.\nThe commitment to protecting women’s sexual and reproductive health is a crucial step towards achieving a more equitable and inclusive world. By reducing preventable deaths and improving access to care, the United Kingdom is actively working to realize the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063 in promoting the well-being of all, regardless of geographic location.\nThe United Kingdom’s support for research and development in low- and middle-income countries, including advancements in drug administration methods, showcases a commitment to reaching even the most remote areas with life-saving care. This approach aligns with the principles of inclusivity and resilience that are fundamental to the global health agenda.\nThe commitment to health security by the United Kingdom through international development is evident in its track record of investing in research, development, and healthcare infrastructure. The impact of these efforts, from malaria treatments to diagnostics for drug-resistant tuberculosis, has been significant and has undoubtedly saved countless lives.\nWe would like to express our deep appreciation for the United Kingdom’s resolute dedication to advancing global health. Their commitment to research, innovation, and international cooperation increases optimism for a healthier and more prosperous world.\nWe look forward to continued collaboration and progress in achieving our shared global health objectives.\nH.E.

However, important changes in health needs, financing and governance necessitate a renewed vision for how they support countries to deliver sustainable impact.\n“With the growing need for strong and resilient health systems that can adapt to emerging threats, while continuing to meet existing health needs, the imperative of optimizing the impact of available resources is becoming increasingly urgent to advance Africa towards universal health coverage,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s Regional Director for Africa.\nFocusing on GHIs as an entry point and catalyst for change in the broader health financing ecosystem, the\nLusaka Agenda\n, published on UHC Day on 12 December 2023, represented the culmination of a 14-month, multi-stakeholder process that captured consensus around five strategic shifts for the long-term evolution of GHIs. The roadmap for the implementation of the Lusaka Agenda implementation in Africa will set out priority actions to realize these shifts.\n“At the 37th African Union (summit in February, African leaders endorsed the establishment of an accountability mechanism within the AU architecture to ensure effective implementation of the Lusaka Agenda on the continent. Our discussions over the past two days began to give shape to what this might look like,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC.\nThe draft roadmap will be refined over the coming months, before it is presented for consideration by  ministers of health at the WHO Regional Committee for Africa, to be held in Brazzaville, Congo, in August this year.\n“The Lusaka Agenda will ensure long-term sustainability and will propel countries towards achieving UHC,” said Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, and co-chair of the Lusaka Agenda Working Group.\nTo deliver more sustainable impact in the face of emerging threats such as climate change and conflicts, the key shifts highlighted in the Lusaka Agenda include a  focus on strengthening primary health care by bolstering health systems, catalysing action on domestic financing,  improving joint approaches to achieving health equity, and strategic and operational coherence among  GHIs. The Lusaka Agenda  also calls for  improved  coordination of approaches to products, reseach and development (R&D) and regional manufacturing, to address market and policy failures in global health.\n“The Lusaka Agenda is now moving from talk to action, led by countries, and GHIs are listening,” added Linda Mafu, the Global Fund’s head of Civil Society and Political Advocacy.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\nAfrican Health Ministers Commit to Purchasing Locally-Made Vaccines – Africa CDC\nSkip to content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nStories\nAfrican Health Ministers Commit to Purchasing Locally-Made Vaccines\nAfrican health ministers have offered to ensure commitment and support to buy vaccines manufactured in Africa to build a sustainable industry capable of producing vaccines at scale.\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) hosted a High-Level meeting themed ”Ministerial Consultations on Local Manufacturing” on the sidelines of the 77\nth\nWorld Health Assembly.\nDuring the ministerial meeting, over 40 ministers of health, representatives from regional economic communities and partners were briefed on the\nfindings\nof the vaccine supplier’s landscape analysis Africa CDC produced in partnership with Clinton Health Access Initiative and PATH, formerly the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health.\nThe ministers offered insights on the continent’s readiness and the challenges that manufacturers currently face, such as getting Africans to buy vaccines manufactured on the continent, which is central to making the business case.\nCurrently, nine commercial-scale production facilities on the continent are prepared for technology transfers, and three manufacturers are set to produce eight vaccines for the African market by 2030. These eight products require purchasers to remain commercially viable beyond their country’s domestic demand.\n“Across the spectrum of requirements for the near-to-market products, predictable demand is the central challenge faced by manufacturers,” the meeting heard.\nAfrica is confronted with limited demand for homegrown vaccine offers, fragmented markets, and poor economies of scale that limit the business case for local manufacturers to invest in vaccine manufacturing facilities and other health product technologies.\nThe ministers suggested fast-track regulatory harmonization to push the wide distribution of medicines and to assure quality. There is a need to strengthen national regulatory authorities and domesticate the\nAU model law at the national level\n.\nThe AU Summit in 2024 decided the establishment of the African Pooled Procurement Mechanism (APPM) as a solution. APPM aims to improve access to quality and affordable health products and promote the localization of manufacturing led by the Africa CDC.\nDuring the briefing, the AU Member states pledged to support the continental ambition, avoid competition amongst member states, and strengthen the regional mechanism to ensure the continent can manufacture the vaccines and other health products it needs. It was reiterated that the African Medicines Agency (AMA) requires member states’ collective support to obtain affordable quality medicines.\nThe meeting allowed partners to share their responses in support of the local manufacturing agenda on the continent. The Africa CDC will pursue critical interventions in vaccine manufacturing to be on course to achieve the ambition of manufacturing 60% of vaccines needed by 2040.

Low health investment and limited prioritization of the health workforce have critically exposed health systems. Investment in health, especially from domestic sources, is still low and inadequate for many countries to meet the universal health coverage and ensure health security\n“The numbers of Africans who have left the continent in search of greener pastures in other parts of the world are staggering. It is a matter that needs to be addressed as a top priority for African governments and indeed all those who wish to see a shift in the historical as well as current trends,” said Honourable Dr Kalumbi Shangula, Minister of Health and Social Services of Namibia.\nThe charter launched today brought together the health workforce investment efforts of all stakeholders, including national governments, the private health sector, civil society, external financing institutions and development partners in Africa.\n“By investing in the health workforce, we not only address the challenges within the sector but also generate dividends in education, employment and gender equality,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “These investments will contribute to our sustained efforts in attracting more resources and improving the quality of our health workforce.”\nInvesting in the health workforce will have positive spin-offs in the form of decent jobs, particularly for women and youth who often face barriers to employment. By providing opportunities for education, training and career progression, the Charter will immensely contribute to the economic empowerment of these demographics and fundamentally support inclusive economic growth.\nAdditionally, health labour force investment also brings multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage.\nFor every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, and that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%.\n“Studies show that investments in the health sector yield substantial economic returns, estimating a nine-to-one return on investment. The new narrative that we are promoting is to transform the health sector to move from liability to an asset for the economy of our countries,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter was inaugurated in Namibia during the Health Workforce Investment Forum being held from 6 to 8 May 2024. Efforts will continue to be made to engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\nAfrican researchers propose Mpox research group – Africa CDC\nSkip to content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nStories\nAfrican researchers propose Mpox research group\nAfrican researchers have proposed setting up a multicountry research group to mitigate against recurring epidemics in Africa and prevent future pandemics. The planned Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) was announced during the Mpox in Africa—High-Level Emergency Regional Meeting, held in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 11 to 13 April. “We propose the establishment of an African-led multi-disciplinary, multicountry Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa with the overarching goal of establishing a research network to advance the elimination of mpox,” Jean B. Nachega (Professor Extraordinary of Medicine Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases Stellenbosch University Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences) told the meeting.\nMpox is endemic to 12 countries in Africa\nNachega said Africa has faced a long-standing unmet need for sustainable local diagnostic laboratories and research capacity for mpox.\n“MpoxReC will address these needs and provide outcome monitoring and surveillance across endemic African countries while simultaneously contributing to much-needed South-South, multi-disciplinary, and inter-professional research collaborations and capacity-building,” he said. He said the continent needs to share national and regional epidemic preparedness frameworks on the disease.\nThe research group, which includes global partners and African collaborators, will initially focus on Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, and the Republic of Congo.  Professor Nadia Sam-Agudu will lead researchers at the University of Cape Coast Ghana, Professor Samuel Nakoune Yandoko will head the team at Pasteur Institute in Bangui, the Central African Republic, co-principal investigators Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe and Professor Placide Mbala will represent the DRC’s Institute National Research Biomedical, Professor Dimie Ogoina from Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital will represent Nigeria, Cameroon’s Pasteur Institute research team will be led by Professor Richard Njouom and Congo will be led by Professor Francine Ntoumi from the Congolese Foundation for Medical Research. Expansion to other African countries will take place later.\n28 April 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nDiseases\nMpox\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

This renders antibiotics and other antimicrobials less effective, causing treatment failures, increased disease spread, severe illness, disability and higher mortality rates.\nDespite the estimated USD2-6 billion needed annually for an effective AMR response across Africa, current funding is only a tenth of that allocated to other major diseases. This underfunding makes AMR a significant barrier to sustainable development, hindering progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.\nAn estimated 700,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections globally. Without timely intervention, this number is projected to reach 10 million by 2050, with Africa accounting for 4.5 million.\n“Fighting disease requires resources and working with member states and our partners we need to do all we can to save lives,” said Dr Tajudeen, speaking at the launch of a report on AMR in Africa. The event also initiated discussions on a roadmap and targets to advance Africa’s battle against AMR. The outcomes are expected to inform the upcoming United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting in September—a crucial platform for global action on this escalating crisis.\nDr Huyam Salih, the director of the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), emphasized the critical role that the AU must play in combating AMR. “Antimicrobial resistance is not just a health issue—it is a threat to our agrifood systems, food safety, food security, livelihoods, and economies,” she said.\nBy 2050, global healthcare costs could exceed USD1 trillion per year, and livestock production could decline by 2.6% to 7.5% annually due to AMR, according to Dr Salih. “In Africa, the situation is particularly alarming, with 37 countries reporting the prevalence of AMR in animal farms, yet only 16% of African countries are conducting routine AMR surveillance in animals as of 2023,” she said.\nDr Salih also called for urgent action to strengthen leadership, expand surveillance and data systems, promote the responsible use of antimicrobials, improve public and animal health systems, and secure sustainable financing to combat AMR effectively. “Our health, our food, and our future depend on the actions we take now,” she stressed.\nDr Tajudeen said addressing AMR in Africa requires engaging all levels of society in a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. “Unless we work together, overcoming antimicrobial resistance will be a difficult and long-drawn process that will cost lives,” he said.\nCurrently, millions in Africa lack access to essential antibiotics, with a study by Africa CDC and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine revealing that only 1.3% of microbiology labs in 14 member states can test for key AMR pathogens.\nThe head of the African Society for Laboratory Medicine, Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, reaffirmed the organization’s commitment to strengthening African laboratory capacities to combat antimicrobial resistance. “Our goal is to ensure the continued efficacy of treatments and promote data-driven solutions to safeguard public health across the continent,” he said.\nDr Tajudeen underscored the importance of prioritizing infection prevention, strengthening health and food systems, developing human resources, ensuring sustainable access to diagnostics and therapeutics, and investing in laboratory infrastructure for effective surveillance and data generation.\nThe report recommends an increase in the availability of high-quality diagnostics, vaccines, and antimicrobials for high-priority pathogens in high-risk African countries.\nFor more information\n:\nMedia inquiries:\nMargaret Edwin,\nDirector of Communication & Public Information Division: Africa CDC | Tel: +251 986 632 878 | Email:\nEdwinM@africacdc.org\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

The equipment was procured and delivered through the support of UNICEF, one of the initiative’s implementing partners. The support aligns with the Africa CDC goal of strengthening healthcare systems and enhancing the response to vaccine-preventable diseases.\nThe cumulative equipment across the five (5) Member States, which consists of 465 refrigerators and freezers, 1,150 temperature monitors, 5,253 vaccine carriers and cold boxes, and 2 cold rooms, all valued up to USD 3.3 million, will significantly enhance the healthcare infrastructure and capabilities. The equipment is designed to efficiently manage vaccines and vital medical supplies, supporting the expansion of COVID-19 vaccination and other programs, including routine Immunization, which aims to ensure safe and effective vaccines reach every child. By expanding the cold chain storage capacity, the Ministries of Health will be able to offer a more comprehensive vaccination program and improve vaccine coverage rates.\nH.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, the Africa CDC Director General, emphasizes the significant benefits of this equipment in minimizing vaccine wastage due to temperature fluctuations. “This optimization allows the Ministries of Health to allocate healthcare budgets more effectively and allocate resources to other critical areas of healthcare. The availability of CCE facilitates extensive immunization activities, reaching remote and underserved communities. This, in turn, leads to improved vaccine coverage rates, reducing the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases, including COVID-19, and strengthening health security in Africa towards attaining global health security,” Dr Kaseya said.\nThe provision of Cold Chain Equipment is crucial in preserving vaccines and maintaining the efficacy of temperature-sensitive medical supplies. The addition of freezers and refrigerators enables member states to store a wider range of vaccines, including those requiring ultra-low temperatures like COVID-19. This expansion of cold chain storage is essential to pandemic preparedness and will enable member states to offer more comprehensive vaccination programs.\nThe cold boxes and vaccine carriers provide reliable transportation while maintaining the recommended vaccine temperature, ensuring vaccine efficacy and safety. This feature increases geographic coverage and contributes to improved immunization service delivery and health security in Africa by enhancing the capacity of Ministries of Health to manage vaccines and strengthen their cold chain systems.\nDuring the handover ceremony in Zambia, the Honorable Sylvia Masebo, the Minister of Health of the Republic of Zambia, highlighted that the support from Afric a CDC aligns with Zambia’s goals to have readily available life-saving vaccines and strengthened cold chain capacity, and the Ministry will seek more equipment to build on the gains made, while implementing the integration of COVID-19 vaccines into primary healthcare services.\nThe Africa CDC, Mastercard Foundation, and UNICEF anticipate the successful installation and efficient use of these CCEs in healthcare facilities, positively catalyzing and strengthening the healthcare landscape in the Member States. With this support, the Ministries of Health are better positioned to respond effectively to public health emergencies, ensuring equitable access to vaccines and treatments. The support provided by the Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation demonstrates their commitment to strengthening healthcare systems in Africa. It underscores the importance of collective collaboration in addressing global health challenges and ensuring vaccine equity for Africa.\nFor more information:\nDr Merawi Aragaw| Head of Division for Surveillance and Disease Intelligence | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: merawia@africa-union.org| M: +251912611294 Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nFor media inquiry:\nFor media enquiries please contact:\nDorothy Njagi\n| Senior Communication Officer- Communication & Public Information directorate | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: email:\nnjagid@africacdc.org\n| Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous Public Health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

This independent body serves as the principal advisory group to WHO AFRO for strategic guidance on all matters pertaining to public health emergency preparedness and response.\nThe EPR Technical Advisory Group will play a critical role in supporting WHO African Member States to fortify health security in the face of diverse emergencies. Countries in the WHO African Region experience over 100 health emergencies annually which disrupt the economy and prosperity of communities and weaken already fragile health systems. With climate change and conflict aggravating more than half of Africa’s health emergencies, the next pandemic is not just a possibility, it's imminent. It is imperative, now more than ever, to enhance the Emergency Preparedness and Response capabilities within the Region.\nComposed of 16 distinguished experts (details below) from diverse fields like epidemiology, public health, global health, vaccinology, paediatrics, nutrition, internal medicine, infectious diseases, programme management, health-care administration, health economics, health communication, sociology, the EPR-TAG advises the WHO AFRO Regional Director on key issues. These include assessing the regional context of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies; conducting horizon scanning for new and emerging threats; providing strategic guidance on preparedness, response, and recovery strategies; reviewing progress in implementing regional health security initiatives; and strengthening country ownership and decision-making in emergency response.\nThe EPR-TAG is chaired by Dr Deo Nshimirimana, a retired WHO medical doctor renowned for his expertise in immunization in emergency settings. Assisting him is Dr Rebecca Martin, Vice President of Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute, appointed as the Vice-Chairperson. Dr Martin brings decades of experience in health security, emergency response and immunization. Both leaders bring a wealth of experience in public health and will guide the EPR-TAG for an initial three-year term. \"The opportunity to lead the EPR-TAG is a great honour, and I am thrilled to be part of this transformative team. I am confident that our collective expertise will significantly contribute to enhancing Africa's preparedness and response capabilities, ensuring a more resilient defence against ongoing and future health threats. Together, we can make a substantial impact on the well-being of African nations.\" - Dr Deo Nshimirimana.\nDr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, commented on the establishment of the EPR-TAG, stating: \"The Emergency Preparedness & Response technical group will play a critical role in strengthening our capacity, working collectively with partners, to support countries to prepare for, respond to, recover from public health emergencies while continuing to provide essential health care, across the African Region. I look forward, with our team, to leveraging its diverse expertise and independent perspective, for the benefit of our Member States.\"\nThe inaugural meeting of this prestigious group is taking place in Saly, Senegal from 16 to 17 July 2024. This gathering marks a historic moment as the EPR-TAG begins its journey to enhance health security across the African region. The establishment of the EPR-TAG underlines WHO AFRO's commitment to building a stronger, more resilient African Region prepared to face any public health challenge. With its expert guidance and collaborative approach, the EPR-TAG will play a vital role in protecting the health and well-being of millions of people across the continent.\nFor more information, please feel free to contact WHO via\neprtag\n[at]\nwho.int\n(eprtag[at]who[dot]int)\nList of the WHO AFRO Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG) Members\nName\nNationality\nDesignation\n1\nDeo NSHIMIRIMANA\n(EPR-TAG Chairperson)\nBurundi\nPublic Health Consultant\n2\nRebecca MARTIN\n(EPR-TAG Vice-Chairperson)\nUSA\nVice President, Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute\n3\nRick BRIGHT\nUSA\nCEO, Bright Global Health\n4\nDeoraj CAUSSY\nMauritius\nEpidemiologist, 360 Epidemiology Solutions\n5\nBernice DAHN\nLiberia\nVice President/Executive Dean, College of Health Sciences, University of Liberia\n6\nWafaa El-SADR\nEgypt\nFounder & Director, ICAP, Columbia University\n7\nNyasha GUZHA-CHANETSA\nZimbabwe\nChief State Veterinarian (Public Health & Trade Facilitation), South African Department of Agriculture, Rural Development & Environment\n8\nBanda KHALIFA\nGhana\nGlobal Health Expert and Managing Director, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Advancing Health Systems Innovations (CAdHSI)\n9\nRodrigue KOHOUN\nBenin\nPHC Technical Advisor to the Ministry of Health, Benin\n10\nAgnes MAHOMVA\nZimbabwe\nPublic Health Advisor to the President and Cabinet, Office of the President and Cabinet, Zimbabwe\n11\nBrice Wilfried BICABA\nBurkina Faso\nDirector General, Health & Public Hygiene, Ministry of Health, Burkina Faso\n12\nCheikh Tidiane MBOW\nSenegal\nChief, Health Promotion & Infectious Diseases Prevention Unit, MONUSCO (Goma)\n13\nSani ALIYU\nNigeria\nConsultant, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases; Cambridge University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust\n14\nEberechukwu (Ebere) OKEREKE\nNigeria\nIndependent Global Health Expert\n15\nJean Marie OKWO-BELE\nDRCongo\nPublic Health Consultant\n16\nHelen REES\nSouth Africa\nExecutive Director, Wits RHI, University of Witwatersrand\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\nHigh-level event kicks off expansion of strategic EU-AU partnership, pledging joint commitments to strengthen Global Health and African Health Sovereignty – Africa CDC\nSkip to content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nPress Releases\nHigh-level event kicks off expansion of strategic EU-AU partnership, pledging joint commitments to strengthen Global Health and African Health Sovereignty\nBrussels, March 19, 2024 –\nThe African Union Commission (AUC) and the European Union hosted a High-level Conference marking the expansion of the strategic EU-AU health partnership. The AU delegation was led by the AUC, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD). The EU delegation was led by the Belgian Presidency of the European Council and the European Commission.\nBuilding on the health commitments of the 6th EU-AU Summit and outcomes of the Addis Ababa AU-EU High-level dialogue, the AU and EU expanded collaboration in priority areas of common interest in the New Public Health Order and the EU Global Health Strategy, such as strengthening pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health, AMR, digital health, climate and health. This collaboration is a positive example of the AU-EU partnership to support global health in multilateral fora. Enhancing equitable access to safe, qualitive, effective and affordable health services and products and national sovereignty will be key to reach SDG-targets such as achieving Universal Health Coverage. Therefore, it is crucial to support social protection systems which incorporate social health protection, aiming at gradually granting universal health coverage as well as at providing income security in case of sickness. The AU and EU further stressed the importance of the health sector in the creation of jobs and growth. They also expressed their commitment to conclude negotiations on a pandemic agreement and International Health Regulations by the May 2024 World Health Assembly.\nMost African countries are struggling to ensure sustainable and equitable access to the health products needed to meet the continent’s priority health needs. At the same time, the EU has expertise in health as well as manufacturing and access, including regulation of health products and has set out clear targets in supporting human development in its international partnerships.\nWith this High-level conference, the EU engages in continued technical collaboration on health in Africa and investments in strengthening Africa’s health security architecture. The EU’s Global Gateway strategy will be key to deliver on these commitments, notably through Team Europe Initiatives, increasing the resilience of European and African health systems in response to the rapidly shifting health burden, social protection, the impact of climate change and emerging health threats while considering innovative science, sharing of technical expertise and knowledge (as well as multi-stakeholder commitments).\nThe Belgian Presidency and the European Commission will follow up on the high-level conference in the European Council and in the governing bodies of the EU’s international cooperation instruments, aligned with shared interests and ambitions of European and African partners.\nAfrican Union Commissioner for Health, Humanitarian Affairs and Social Development,\nH.E. Amb. Minata Samate Cessouma\n“\nThe establishment of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) marks a crucial step forward in safeguarding health security on the continent by ensuring the availability and the accessibility of quality pharmaceutical products. This availability and accessibility facilitate prevention strategies and rapid responses to health emergencies, strengthening regulatory capacities and promoting regional cooperation and harmonisation of standards. By harmonising regulatory processes and promoting access to effectual medical products, the AMA can significantly enhance public health outcomes and promote sustainable development in Africa, as envisioned in the Africa Health Strategy (2016-2030) and the African Union Agenda 2063. AMA is also envisioned to bolster research and development efforts within the continent, fostering innovation and self-reliance in addressing health challenges specific to the continent. Looking to the future, the African Union Commission is enthusiastic about knowledge-sharing between the European Union and Africa to leverage the experience of establishing the European Mediines Agency to chart guidance and regulatory pathways for the development and approval of new manufacturing technologies and processes.\nBelgian Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities,\nH.E. Caroline GENNEZ\n“\nThe EU and Africa express a shared vision of health as the precondition for social development. African countries have extensive experience in the containment of epidemics; European countries have some of the best and most accessible healthcare in the world. Global health is an area in which the EU offers added value as a partner to Africa based on its expertise and experience. Europe bolsters its international partnerships by focusing on its unique selling proposition. Our cooperation on this front will improve health outcomes for countless of people, in Africa and Europe. Our focus will be on building affordable, available and high-quality healthcare systems.\n”\nEuropean Commissioner for International Partnerships,\nH.E. Jutta URPILAINEN\n“\nLearning the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, the AU and the EU are committed to advance health systems and strengthen health capacities globally. This joint commitment was well reflected in the Global Gateway investment package, which we presented at the AU-EU Summit of 2022. We are proud of the results achieved in increasing local manufacturing of medicines and vaccines in Africa, for Africa. Today we launch three major Team Europe Initiatives on health security, digital health and public health institutes, and strengthen cooperation between our institutions. This is another step forward to better confront evolving health challenges and to enhance the resilience of our communities.\n”\nEuropean Commissioner for Health and Food Safety,\nH.E. Stella KYRIAKIDES\n“\nAn ever-closer partnership between the African Union and the European Union is indispensable for public health. We want to work more closely with our African partners on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health and anti-microbial resistance, as well as the health effects of climate change. These are core objectives for our EU Global Health Strategy and the foundations of our cooperation with the African continent. We are now at a critical stage of the negotiations on the pandemic agreement and the international health regulations, with which we would provide new multilateral solutions to common challenges. The EU is committed to conclude the negotiations by May, a responsibility equally shared by all nations. I am pleased that the African Union and EU are joining voices and taking concrete steps to support global health internationally.\n”\nAfrica CDC Director General,\nH.E Dr Jean Kaseya\n“As we navigate the complexities of global health, Africa is on the path towards self-sufficiency through equitable access to medical products. Africa’s target of producing 60% of vaccines by 2040 through the Africa CDC underscores our commitment to health sovereignty. Through strategic partnerships like the EU-AU collaboration, we accelerate our capabilities, leveraging expertise and resources to build resilient health systems and strengthen Pandemic preparedness.”\nSpecific outcomes of the high-level conference include the following concrete engagements:\nWorking Arrangement between Africa CDC and the European Commission to best implement the expanded strategic AU-EU Health partnership;\nThe European Commission and the Belgian Presidency announced additional TEI MAV+ funding for the advancement of the African Medicines Agency;\nThe announcement of procurement commitments by Global Health Initiatives to buy in Africa for Africa;\nThree additional Team Europe Initiatives on health were launched: Health Security using a One Health approach, Digital Health, and Public Health Institutes;\nThe Team Europe Initiative (TEI) on Social Protection was launched;\nWork product leads for Team Europe and Team Africa were confirmed;\nA new programme ‘SafeBirth Africa’ to support improved access to innovative life-saving commodities for sexual and reproductive health in Africa. The programme will be implemented by Unitaid and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), supported by a financial contribution of €20 million from the EU budget under the Team Europe Initiative on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights that was launched in Kigali in December 2022;\nAn expanded AU-EU High Level Steering Meeting (HLSM) at DG-level will jointly oversee regional heath TEIs.\n-END-\nMedia inquiry:\nCommunication and Public Information Directorate| Africa CDC | Email:\nCommunications@africacdc.org\n20 March 2024\nTheme\nNew Public Health Order\n,\nRespectful Partnership\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

This mandate was established in July, 2022, by the Executive Council of the Africa Union (AU) Assembly through its decision EX.CL/Dec.1169(XLI), empowering Africa CDC to coordinate responses to epidemics by mobilising African leaders, governments, and relevant agencies.\nThe decision was driven by the worsening mpox situation on the continent: since 2022, 40 874 cases and 1512 deaths have been reported across 15 AU member states. In 2024 alone, 17 541 cases and 517 deaths have been reported from 13 AU member states. These figures represent a 160% and 19% increase in the number of cases and deaths, respectively, in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. A 79% increase in the number of cases was observed in 2023 compared with 2022. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounts for 96% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported in 2024.\nInvestigations in the DRC suggest that heterosexual transmission, especially among female sex workers (9%), is driving the outbreak,\ncontrasting with the spread mainly among men who have sex with men in Europe in 2022. The high prevalence among women raises concerns about vertical transmission risks and adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nThe high risk of severe infection among people living with HIV, considerations for asymptomatic infections, poor vaccination strategies, limited access to medical countermeasures, and low detection rates were other concerns. The outbreak is further complicated by a high case fatality rate of over 3·9%, particularly among children younger than 15 years, who account for 60% of cases. Cross-border movements, low public awareness, high vulnerability due to factors such as HIV and malnutrition, limited understanding of mpox transmission, and insufficient response capacities, including vaccine shortages, pose significant challenges to containment. The risk of mpox spreading to neighbouring countries and globally is high.\nThe day before the PHECS announcement, 15 of the 20-member Emergency Consultative Group (ECG) met to advise the Africa CDC Director General on whether the mpox outbreak constituted a PHECS. The group redefined PHECS as a significant event posing a risk to other countries, requiring immediate continental-level action to prevent and mitigate disease spread—expanding the original definition in the Africa CDC statute.\nThey also developed specific criteria to assess the situation objectively. These criteria, organised into nine areas, included: disease severity, transmission dynamics, impact on health systems, vaccine and treatment availability, public health risk, economic and social impact, public concern, global health security, and political considerations (\ntable\n). The framework was developed to guide a transparent and consistent decision-making process for declaring a PHECS in Africa.\nRead more –\nMpox outbreaks in Africa constitute a public health emergency of continental security\n21 August 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\n,\nPublic Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS)\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nDiseases\nMpox\nTags\nMpox\n,\nMpox Vaccine\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

A wider malaria vaccine rollout is underway this year in several African countries, with Cameroon being the first outside the malaria vaccine pilot programme to do so.\nCameroon launched the vaccine on 22 January 2024. It is being integrated into its national routine immunization programme in more than 500 public and private health facilities across 42 health districts in the country’s 10 regions.\nBurkina Faso introduced the vaccine on 5 February, becoming the latest country in the region to kick off the immunization. The game-changing vaccine complements the existing range of malaria control measures to prevent the disease and lower its burden.\n“Malaria is one of the major health challenges our region faces. The wider rollout of the malaria vaccine marks a significant milestone in advancing the fight against this deadly disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. “We’re committed to supporting countries to ensure that all eligible children are protected from the devastating impacts of this preventable illness.”\nThe vaccine rollout in the two countries mark the start of a major initiative by the WHO Regional Office for Africa’s Accelerated Malaria Vaccines Introduction and Rollout in Africa (AMVIRA).\nAMVIRA was developed as a response to the planned introduction of the two malaria vaccines (RTS,S and R21) into the routine immunization schedules of 19 countries\n[1]\nthe Africa region in 2024. Through AMVIRA, WHO in Africa will strengthen the provision of state-of-the-art support to countries in their efforts to effectively and efficiently introduce and rollout malaria vaccines. The initiative also enhances coordination with partners, UNICEF, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and other partners.\nIn support of countries to ensure smooth introduction, community understanding and acceptance, and strengthened logistics, WHO has deployed 69 experts in immunization, data science and communication, across all 10 regions in Cameroon, as well as in Burkina Faso.\nWHO is working with countries to set up comprehensive preparations such as national vaccination policy and guidelines, integrating the new vaccine into the delivery schedule of other vaccines and health interventions, developing an operational roll out plan, training of healthcare workers, investing in infrastructure, technical capacity, vaccine storage, community engagement and demand generation, and ensuring formative supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the process to ensure quality vaccine delivery.\nAs the malaria vaccine rollout extends to all eligible countries, WHO will continue to ensure that experts are deployed where needed, implement robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track progress, identify challenges and facilitate timely interventions where required. The effective strategies that were witnessed in Cameroon and Burkina Faso are being documented and will be shared with other countries as they prepare for and launch the vaccines.\nMalaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of related deaths in 2022. There were 249 million malaria cases globally in 2022, leading to 608 000 deaths. Of these deaths, 77% were children under 5 years of age, mostly in Africa.\n[1]\nBenin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Niger, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Mozambique, Nigeria and South Sudan\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\nNew framework launched to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa | WHO | Regional Office for Africa\nSkip to main content\nWHO Africa\nNew framework launched to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa\nNew framework launched to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa\n12 June 2024\nA new, comprehensive framework has been launched to guide health authorities, policy-makers and other stakeholders towards elimination of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as a public health problem in eastern Africa.\nAlso known as kala-azar, VL is a deadly parasitic disease that causes fever, weight loss, spleen and liver enlargement, and – if untreated – death. Transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies, VL is endemic in 80 countries around the world. In 2022, eastern Africa accounted for 73% of global VL cases, half of which occurred in children aged under 15 years.\nThe\nelimination framework\noutlines five main strategies for guiding VL elimination: (i) early diagnosis and treatment; (ii) integrated vector management; (iii) effective surveillance; (iv) advocacy, social mobilization and partnership-building; and (v) implementation and operational research. It also describes a stepwise process for implementing the main elimination phases and sets country and regional targets; these include a 90% reduction in VL burden in the eastern Africa sub-region to fewer than 1500 cases per year by 2030; detection and treatment of 90% of cases within 30 days of onset of symptoms by 2030; a 100% decline in VL deaths in children by 2030; 100% of VL–HIV patients started on antiretroviral therapy; and the detection, reporting and management of all post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) cases.\nRead more\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\nPartnership for Public Health Emergencies Preparedness & Response Seeks 1 Billion USD | Africa CDC and WHO Strengthen Efforts to Safeguard Africa's Health – Africa CDC\nSkip to content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nStories\nPartnership for Public Health Emergencies Preparedness & Response Seeks 1 Billion USD | Africa CDC and WHO Strengthen Efforts to Safeguard Africa’s Health\nAfrica’s two leading public health institutions are seeking 1 billion USD for their partnership to respond to public health emergencies triggered by climate change and conflict-related disasters, aiming to build health security on the continent.\nAfrica CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) met on 27 May in Geneva, a year after launching the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) at the 76th World Health Assembly.\n“The JEAP is looking forward to mobilizing close to 1 billion USD to address critical gaps and strengthen the systems on the continent to better prepare, detect, and respond to health emergencies by 2027,” said Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC. “We think we can make it happen if we put our hands together,” he told the partners at the meeting.\nFor the first time, the JEAP partnership developed 17 multi-country and regional proposals for submission to the second round of the Pandemic Fund compared to fewer than three in the first round.\n“We are aware that the pandemic envelope is limited in meeting all needs, and that is why we are inviting you to join the JEAP movement,” said Dr. Kaseya.\nJEAP is a five-year strategic collaboration aimed at boosting emergency preparedness and response efforts throughout Africa, helping to ensure effective responses to disease outbreaks during humanitarian crises. On average, 100 disease outbreaks are reported annually in Africa.\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “JEAP will bolster our efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” she said.\nThe plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives, including the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order and WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030).\nJEAP prioritizes strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection, stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations, and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. They also plan to overcome supply chain barriers by reducing delays in delivering lifesaving supplies from 20 days to 24-48 hours, mitigating morbidity and mortality. The JEAP partnership welcomed UNICEF as the first partner to join this partnership, which holds great promise for transforming health security on the continent.\n29 May 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Key stakeholders will gather to consolidate efforts to drive up investment to counter critical health worker shortages.\nWith a bold target of halving Africa’s critical 5.3-million health workforce shortage by 2030, the African Health Workforce Investment Charter will mobilize and align domestic and partner funding to strengthen, grow and retain the continent’s health workforce, especially in rural and primary health care settings.\n“Africa’s health worker sector is at a crossroads. The underinvestment in training and employing health workers, coupled with inadequate incentives to retain the workforce, has resulted in unfortunate levels of migration, both within and out of the continent.” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “It is time to urgently invest more and in smarter ways in our health workforce. Our future depends on it.”\nAddressing the gaps necessitates a continent-wide increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expenditure on health of up to 1.5%, with more than half of that dedicated to health workforce investment specifically.\nDespite a 13% improvement in efficiency between 2014 and 2019, African health systems remain only 77% efficient. In effect, this means that about US$1 in every US$5 spent on health is lost to technical inefficiencies, including health workforce management. This plays a significant role in the existence of ghost workers on payrolls, absenteeism and sub-optimal performance, for example.\nAt the upcoming forum, stakeholders will discuss the progress made in health workforce strengthening over the last 10 years and hammer out the details of new strategies to, among other things, protect health workforce budgets, address recurrent costs, and bolster investments amid existing domestic and global economic challenges, and debt concerns.\nThe forum will also engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.\nInvestment in the health workforce has multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, especially benefiting women and young people, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage.\nFor every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, noting that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%.\nAbout 170 participants are expected to attend the forum, including policy makers from the health, education, labour/employment and finance sectors, along with partners from civil society financing, bilateral and multilateral institutions.\nKey partners supporting the forum include the ILO-OECD-WHO Working for Health (W4H) Programme and its Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF), The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Frontline Health Workers Coalition.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\nPRESS STATEMENT: Africa CDC committed to supporting the replenishment of Gavi funds in Paris – Africa CDC\nSkip to content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nStatement\nPRESS STATEMENT: Africa CDC committed to supporting the replenishment of Gavi funds in Paris\nAddis Ababa, 9 June\n– The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is the continental public health agency mandated to support African member states in building robust and resilient health systems. Its mission is to safeguard Africa’s health security and accelerate the achievement of universal health coverage.\nAfrica CDC’s strategic focus is on three critical priorities: (1) outbreak and pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response; (2) health systems strengthening, with an emphasis on primary health care and community health; and (3) effective local manufacturing of health commodities, including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.\nAfrica CDC recognizes Gavi as a pivotal partner for health security and collective resilience to vaccine-preventable diseases across the continent. Indeed, from 2000 to 2022, Gavi invested US$11.9 billion to enhance access to life-saving vaccines in Africa, resulting in 11.1 million future deaths averted in Africa.\nThis week, the Gavi Board approved the Gavi Alliance’s new five-year strategy (2026-2030), focusing on accelerating vaccine coverage, introducing new vaccines, strengthening health systems for equity, and supporting global health security and regional vaccine manufacturing. As a public-private partnership, Gavi is funded through replenishment events hosted by donor governments to mobilize support from governments, philanthropies, the private sector, various institutions, civil society organizations, and individuals.In a show of commitment and support as the continent is the primary beneficiary of Gavi funds, Africa CDC and the African Union and African member states stand ready to fully support the 2024 replenishment event hosted by France in Paris on June 20th.\nThis 2024 replenishment meeting will be unique, highlighting Gavi’s support for Africa’s crucial agenda of local manufacturing, as endorsed by African Heads of State under the Africa CDC’s Platform for Harmonized Health Manufacturing in Africa (PHAHM). Indeed, Gavi will unveil a groundbreaking US$1 billion commitment over ten years through a new initiative called the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), aimed at bolstering African health security and sovereignty. At the Gavi Board meeting on June 7th, the Director General of Africa CDC, H.E. Dr Jean Kaseya, underscored the importance of respectful partnership and collaboration, stating, “Local manufacturing is the second independence of Africa because it impacts our health security and economic growth.\nAdditionally, Africa CDC will spearhead the Lusaka agenda to strengthen national leadership and partner coordination for effective implementation of the One Plan, One Budget, and One M&E Framework.\n“In recognition of AVMA’s significance to Africa, Dr. Kaseya announced that the popular launch of AVMA will occur on African soil in the coming weeks. This momentous occasion will bring together African leaders, Gavi, donors and partners, African Civil Society Organizations, and communities to reflect on and celebrate the journey toward Africa’s self-reliance in manufacturing vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.Together, we stand on the brink of a new era for Africa’s self-reliance in health security, driven by innovation, partnership, and a shared vision for a safer, healthier, and more prosperous Africa.\nAbout Africa CDC:\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (AfricaCDC) is the African Union’s continental autonomous public health agency that supports member states in strengthening health systems and improving surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

Under a transformative initiative, the Organization has embarked on a mission to establish three emergency hubs in the region.\nThe WHO Regional Emergency Hub in Dakar launched today is the second of its kind after WHO and the Government of Kenya launched the Nairobi health emergency hub in 2022. A health emergency hub in Pretoria is planned to be launched in 2024.\n“This hub, with its various functions that include strategic pre-positioning of emergency health supplies, will enable the WHO Regional Office for Africa to support countries affected by health or humanitarian crises respond faster and in a more structured manner,” said Amadou Ba, Prime Minister of Senegal.\nThe African region faces the highest number of health emergencies globally each year. As of November 2023, the region was grappling with more than 130 disease outbreaks. In West Africa’s Sahel region, more than 33 million people across six countries currently require urgent need of life-saving humanitarian assistance.\nThe goal of the regional emergency hubs is to substantially reduce – from an average of 45 days previously to three days – the time it takes to deliver life-saving, effective emergency response to countries after a public health event has been declared. This is critical to make meaningful difference in the plight of people affected by crises and to effectively control and end disease outbreaks.\nThe health emergency hubs also serve as centres of excellence, aiming to train more than 3000 African experts, equipping them with key technical skills essential for effective response to health emergencies. Each of the three centres has a specialized function, capitalizing on the comparative advantages afforded by each host country.\n“I extend my heartfelt appreciation to all those who have contributed to establishing this essential facility,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Our work through this hub aligns with the current global dynamic towards emergency preparedness, vaccine manufacturing, supply chain and effective tools to better respond to public health crises.”\nThe Senegal hub specializes in supply chain management, data analysis, innovation and information management, the Kenya hub focuses on the development of emergency medical personnel, while that in south Africa specializes on research and development, and genomic surveillance.\nSince September 2022 when the temporary warehouse in Nairobi became operational the delivery time of critical emergency health supplies and equipment within the region has drastically reduced from at least three weeks to an average of three days. The deployment of responders has also been reduced.\nThe Government of Senegal has allocated five hectares of land for the construction of the Regional Emergency Hub in the outskirts of Dakar. The 8000-square-metre building has a 100-person office space. Additionally, the government has allocated 5000-square-metre container yard and is facilitating speedy custom clearance processes for inbound and outbound supplies.\nThe hubs in Kenya and Senegal feature a warehouse for prepositioning medical supplies and equipment, a state-of-the-art training facility, an infectious diseases unit, an emergency response simulation facility and a training camp for health emergency first responders.\nThe Regional Emergency Hubs will work in close cooperation with partners and the broader United Nations ecosystem to support countries. WHO is also collaborating closely with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\nThe African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator is a Boon for the Continent – Africa CDC\nSkip to content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nStories\nThe African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator is a Boon for the Continent\nThe Gavi Board’s approval of the Gavi Alliance’s new five-year strategy (2026-2030), which focuses on accelerating vaccine coverage, introducing new vaccines, strengthening health systems for equity, and supporting global health security and regional vaccine manufacturing, has given Africa CDC impetus on its quest for local vaccine manufacturing.\nOn 20 June 2024, a high-level event co-hosted in Paris by the Government of France, the African Union, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, along with the support of Team Europe, launched the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA). This initiative will provide financial incentives to help vaccine manufacturers in Africa scale up production and become sustainable on a long-term basis.\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance, launched its replenishment campaign asking for $9 billion in new pledges, out of a total need of $11.9 billion, with $2.9 billion available in existing donor pledges, investment income, and leftover resources from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gavi has received $2.4 billion in new pledges, with $1.58 billion of that coming from the United States.\n“Today is a great day for Africa, thanks to this event,” said Dr. Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC Director General, at the event. “This financing will continue to reduce the gap and increase fairness and equity,” he said. “We are launching AVMA today, which will allow us, between now and 2040, to produce 60% of our vaccines,” Dr. Kaseya added.\nHe also announced that Africa will organize a launching ceremony of AVMA in Africa for African leaders, partners, non-governmental organizations, and community organizations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to ensure regional diversification of vaccine manufacturing. A lack of local manufacturing capacity in Africa and other parts of the world meant that the African continent had to wait longer for vaccines to become available. “Our vision is not restricted to only producing vaccines locally but also covers the production of drugs, diagnostics, and other healing products,” Dr. Kaseya said.\n“With our Alliance on track to meet almost all of the goals we set for 2025, we need also to consider how we can accelerate our progress and broaden the protection we can provide to populations for the rest of this decade,” said Professor José Manuel Barroso, Chair of the Board of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “As Gavi sets these ambitious goals, I am grateful for the leadership of France, the African Union, and Africa CDC as we make the case for investing in immunization and strengthening global health security.”\nMeanwhile, on the sidelines of the Global Forum for Vaccine Sovereignty and Innovation in Paris, France, the Africa CDC and African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) renewed their partnership with a new cooperation agreement announced on 20 June. Through this collaboration, Afreximbank committed a USD 2 billion facility to the “Africa Health Security Investment Plan” to support the health product manufacturing ambition of the continent. This initiative will focus on the African Pooled Procurement Mechanism (APPM) and the Platform for Harmonized African Health Products Manufacturing (PHAHM). It also intends to complement GAVI’s innovative financing mechanism, the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), which is set to provide up to USD 1 billion in financing to African manufacturers of health and pharmaceutical products over the next ten years.\n28 June 2024\nTheme\nAVMA\n,\nAfrican Vaccine Manufacturing\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

We welcome the opportunity to build synergies with BMFG and other partners in this effort to leverage data in the fight against diseases,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nDiscussions during the engagement centered on the alignment between the vision and strategies of the UCN cluster and the BMGF, and how this can inform the work of the PPHM programme as it works to support and enhance the use of data analytics at both regional and country level.\nFurthermore, the WHO Africa Regional Office and BMFG express commitment to continue to work closely, through the UCN Cluster and PPHM, to support the many areas identified for collaboration, with an initial focus on the eradication of malaria in the region.\n“We recognize the need to leverage data for public health decision-making. We are looking forward to building synergies with the WHO Africa Regional Office to support countries in the region in their efforts to use data-informed solutions to fight disease,” says Jennifer Gardy.\nPPH was established as a special strategic initiative to deepen the precision public health for Africa (PPH4Africa) strategic initiative, advancing the deployment of analytics towards health systems strengthening and response. This vision is aligned with ongoing efforts to strengthen capacity on epidemiological modelling for public health decision-making in sub-Saharan Africa, already supported by BMFG.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nNyandoh Paho TADFOR\nCommunication Officer\nRegional Office for Africa\nEmail:\nnyandoht\n[at]\nwho.int\n(nyandoht[at]who[dot]int)\nWHO Africa welcomes Gavi’s commitment to Africa vaccine manufacture, immunization and pandemic preparedness | WHO | Regional Office for Africa\nSkip to main content\nWHO Africa\nWHO Africa welcomes Gavi’s commitment to Africa vaccine manufacture, immunization and pandemic preparedness\nWHO Africa welcomes Gavi’s commitment to Africa vaccine manufacture, immunization and pandemic preparedness\n12 December 2023\nBrazzaville\n– The quest to protect Africa from vaccine-preventable diseases has received a significant boost, with the commitment of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to invest US$ 1.8 billion to support  African vaccine manufacturing, catching up missed children and pandemic preparedness.\nThe decision taken last week by the Gavi Board at its meeting in Accra, Ghana will help the continent to recover from the impact COVID-19 pandemic and be better prepared to respond to future public health emergencies.\nThis commitment comes at an opportune time when the sub-Saharan African region is witnessing stalled progress in immunization coverage, with the number of African children missing routine vaccinations rising from 6.2 million in 2019 to  7.8 million in 2022, translating into 2.8 million zero-dose children from 2019 to 2022 cumulatively.\nFurthermore, the establishment of the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), a financing instrument that will make up to US$1 billion, will strengthen ongoing efforts towards local vaccine manufacturing and address vaccine equity gaps identified during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“The pandemic highlighted beyond any doubt the critical importance of vaccination as a public health tool. This decision by the Board of Gavi will contribute significantly to saving lives and livelihoods,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nAt the 2023 WHO Africa Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group (RITAG) and the Immunization Stakeholders meeting, experts shared their commitment to advance efforts toward the attainment of global immunization. Therefore, through  WHO’s coordination role, the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF), which facilitated the regulatory environment required for COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the RITAG have been positioned and ready to support these commitments by Gavi for a deepened outcome.\nThe WHO Regional Office for Africa also welcomes the decision by  Gavi to translate lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic into concrete public health interventions, with a US$ 500 million investment to ensure the availability of funds for a future pandemic.\nThe lessons learned from decades of fighting and preventing diseases, including most recently,  COVID-19 have led to the vision and strategies, articulated in WHO Africa Regional Office’s Ending Disease in Africa: vision, strategies and Special Initiatives, 2023-2030, which will drive the work moving forward, including the vital acceleration of immunization uptake across the region.\nAnchored on this new strategy, WHO has supported countries in Africa in the development of innovative country plans to catch up with children who missed routine immunization.\nThis new strategy aligns with Gavi’s focus on protecting the next generation — particularly zero-dose children — through strengthening regional and country capacities on immunization and other diagnostics and therapeutics.\n“For us as WHO, serving about a billion people in 47 African countries, we welcome the opportunity to strengthen our ongoing collaboration with Gavi, Africa CDC and other partners to translate this latest commitment into action towards ending diseases in Africa,” Dr Moeti said.\nFor more information on the fight against diseases in Africa, see related links.\nEnding diseases in Africa\nStatus of Immunization in Africa\nThe roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa\nCountry Profiles on Immunization Coverage in the African Region\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nSayibu Ibrahim Suhuyini\nCommunications Officer\nWHO Ghana Country Office\nEmail:\nsayibui\n[at]\nwho.int\n(sayibui[at]who[dot]int)\nTel: +233 25 795 7942\nNyandoh Paho TADFOR\nCommunication Officer\nRegional Office for Africa\nEmail:\nnyandoht\n[at]\nwho.int\n(nyandoht[at]who[dot]int)",

This mandate was established in July, 2022, by the Executive Council of the Africa Union (AU) Assembly through its decision EX.CL/Dec.1169(XLI), empowering Africa CDC to coordinate responses to epidemics by mobilising African leaders, governments, and relevant agencies.\nThe decision was driven by the worsening mpox situation on the continent: since 2022, 40 874 cases and 1512 deaths have been reported across 15 AU member states. In 2024 alone, 17 541 cases and 517 deaths have been reported from 13 AU member states. These figures represent a 160% and 19% increase in the number of cases and deaths, respectively, in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. A 79% increase in the number of cases was observed in 2023 compared with 2022. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounts for 96% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported in 2024.\nInvestigations in the DRC suggest that heterosexual transmission, especially among female sex workers (9%), is driving the outbreak,\ncontrasting with the spread mainly among men who have sex with men in Europe in 2022. The high prevalence among women raises concerns about vertical transmission risks and adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nThe high risk of severe infection among people living with HIV, considerations for asymptomatic infections, poor vaccination strategies, limited access to medical countermeasures, and low detection rates were other concerns. The outbreak is further complicated by a high case fatality rate of over 3·9%, particularly among children younger than 15 years, who account for 60% of cases. Cross-border movements, low public awareness, high vulnerability due to factors such as HIV and malnutrition, limited understanding of mpox transmission, and insufficient response capacities, including vaccine shortages, pose significant challenges to containment. The risk of mpox spreading to neighbouring countries and globally is high.\nThe day before the PHECS announcement, 15 of the 20-member Emergency Consultative Group (ECG) met to advise the Africa CDC Director General on whether the mpox outbreak constituted a PHECS. The group redefined PHECS as a significant event posing a risk to other countries, requiring immediate continental-level action to prevent and mitigate disease spread—expanding the original definition in the Africa CDC statute.\nThey also developed specific criteria to assess the situation objectively. These criteria, organised into nine areas, included: disease severity, transmission dynamics, impact on health systems, vaccine and treatment availability, public health risk, economic and social impact, public concern, global health security, and political considerations (\ntable\n). The framework was developed to guide a transparent and consistent decision-making process for declaring a PHECS in Africa.\nRead more –\nMpox outbreaks in Africa constitute a public health emergency of continental security\n21 August 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\n,\nPublic Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS)\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nDiseases\nMpox\nTags\nMpox\n,\nMpox Vaccine\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

A wider malaria vaccine rollout is underway this year in several African countries, with Cameroon being the first outside the malaria vaccine pilot programme to do so.\nCameroon launched the vaccine on 22 January 2024. It is being integrated into its national routine immunization programme in more than 500 public and private health facilities across 42 health districts in the country’s 10 regions.\nBurkina Faso introduced the vaccine on 5 February, becoming the latest country in the region to kick off the immunization. The game-changing vaccine complements the existing range of malaria control measures to prevent the disease and lower its burden.\n“Malaria is one of the major health challenges our region faces. The wider rollout of the malaria vaccine marks a significant milestone in advancing the fight against this deadly disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. “We’re committed to supporting countries to ensure that all eligible children are protected from the devastating impacts of this preventable illness.”\nThe vaccine rollout in the two countries mark the start of a major initiative by the WHO Regional Office for Africa’s Accelerated Malaria Vaccines Introduction and Rollout in Africa (AMVIRA).\nAMVIRA was developed as a response to the planned introduction of the two malaria vaccines (RTS,S and R21) into the routine immunization schedules of 19 countries\n[1]\nthe Africa region in 2024. Through AMVIRA, WHO in Africa will strengthen the provision of state-of-the-art support to countries in their efforts to effectively and efficiently introduce and rollout malaria vaccines. The initiative also enhances coordination with partners, UNICEF, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and other partners.\nIn support of countries to ensure smooth introduction, community understanding and acceptance, and strengthened logistics, WHO has deployed 69 experts in immunization, data science and communication, across all 10 regions in Cameroon, as well as in Burkina Faso.\nWHO is working with countries to set up comprehensive preparations such as national vaccination policy and guidelines, integrating the new vaccine into the delivery schedule of other vaccines and health interventions, developing an operational roll out plan, training of healthcare workers, investing in infrastructure, technical capacity, vaccine storage, community engagement and demand generation, and ensuring formative supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the process to ensure quality vaccine delivery.\nAs the malaria vaccine rollout extends to all eligible countries, WHO will continue to ensure that experts are deployed where needed, implement robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track progress, identify challenges and facilitate timely interventions where required. The effective strategies that were witnessed in Cameroon and Burkina Faso are being documented and will be shared with other countries as they prepare for and launch the vaccines.\nMalaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of related deaths in 2022. There were 249 million malaria cases globally in 2022, leading to 608 000 deaths. Of these deaths, 77% were children under 5 years of age, mostly in Africa.\n[1]\nBenin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Niger, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Mozambique, Nigeria and South Sudan\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)",

Transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies, VL is endemic in 80 countries around the world. In 2022, eastern Africa accounted for 73% of global VL cases, half of which occurred in children aged under 15 years.\nThe\nelimination framework\noutlines five main strategies for guiding VL elimination: (i) early diagnosis and treatment; (ii) integrated vector management; (iii) effective surveillance; (iv) advocacy, social mobilization and partnership-building; and (v) implementation and operational research. It also describes a stepwise process for implementing the main elimination phases and sets country and regional targets; these include a 90% reduction in VL burden in the eastern Africa sub-region to fewer than 1500 cases per year by 2030; detection and treatment of 90% of cases within 30 days of onset of symptoms by 2030; a 100% decline in VL deaths in children by 2030; 100% of VL–HIV patients started on antiretroviral therapy; and the detection, reporting and management of all post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) cases.\nRead more\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)",

On average, 100 disease outbreaks are reported annually in Africa.\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “JEAP will bolster our efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” she said.\nThe plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives, including the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order and WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030).\nJEAP prioritizes strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection, stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations, and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. They also plan to overcome supply chain barriers by reducing delays in delivering lifesaving supplies from 20 days to 24-48 hours, mitigating morbidity and mortality. The JEAP partnership welcomed UNICEF as the first partner to join this partnership, which holds great promise for transforming health security on the continent.\n29 May 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Key stakeholders will gather to consolidate efforts to drive up investment to counter critical health worker shortages.\nWith a bold target of halving Africa’s critical 5.3-million health workforce shortage by 2030, the African Health Workforce Investment Charter will mobilize and align domestic and partner funding to strengthen, grow and retain the continent’s health workforce, especially in rural and primary health care settings.\n“Africa’s health worker sector is at a crossroads. The underinvestment in training and employing health workers, coupled with inadequate incentives to retain the workforce, has resulted in unfortunate levels of migration, both within and out of the continent.” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “It is time to urgently invest more and in smarter ways in our health workforce. Our future depends on it.”\nAddressing the gaps necessitates a continent-wide increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expenditure on health of up to 1.5%, with more than half of that dedicated to health workforce investment specifically.\nDespite a 13% improvement in efficiency between 2014 and 2019, African health systems remain only 77% efficient. In effect, this means that about US$1 in every US$5 spent on health is lost to technical inefficiencies, including health workforce management. This plays a significant role in the existence of ghost workers on payrolls, absenteeism and sub-optimal performance, for example.\nAt the upcoming forum, stakeholders will discuss the progress made in health workforce strengthening over the last 10 years and hammer out the details of new strategies to, among other things, protect health workforce budgets, address recurrent costs, and bolster investments amid existing domestic and global economic challenges, and debt concerns.\nThe forum will also engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.\nInvestment in the health workforce has multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, especially benefiting women and young people, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage.\nFor every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, noting that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%.\nAbout 170 participants are expected to attend the forum, including policy makers from the health, education, labour/employment and finance sectors, along with partners from civil society financing, bilateral and multilateral institutions.\nKey partners supporting the forum include the ILO-OECD-WHO Working for Health (W4H) Programme and its Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF), The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Frontline Health Workers Coalition.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)",

Its mission is to safeguard Africa’s health security and accelerate the achievement of universal health coverage.\nAfrica CDC’s strategic focus is on three critical priorities: (1) outbreak and pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response; (2) health systems strengthening, with an emphasis on primary health care and community health; and (3) effective local manufacturing of health commodities, including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.\nAfrica CDC recognizes Gavi as a pivotal partner for health security and collective resilience to vaccine-preventable diseases across the continent. Indeed, from 2000 to 2022, Gavi invested US$11.9 billion to enhance access to life-saving vaccines in Africa, resulting in 11.1 million future deaths averted in Africa.\nThis week, the Gavi Board approved the Gavi Alliance’s new five-year strategy (2026-2030), focusing on accelerating vaccine coverage, introducing new vaccines, strengthening health systems for equity, and supporting global health security and regional vaccine manufacturing. As a public-private partnership, Gavi is funded through replenishment events hosted by donor governments to mobilize support from governments, philanthropies, the private sector, various institutions, civil society organizations, and individuals.In a show of commitment and support as the continent is the primary beneficiary of Gavi funds, Africa CDC and the African Union and African member states stand ready to fully support the 2024 replenishment event hosted by France in Paris on June 20th.\nThis 2024 replenishment meeting will be unique, highlighting Gavi’s support for Africa’s crucial agenda of local manufacturing, as endorsed by African Heads of State under the Africa CDC’s Platform for Harmonized Health Manufacturing in Africa (PHAHM). Indeed, Gavi will unveil a groundbreaking US$1 billion commitment over ten years through a new initiative called the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), aimed at bolstering African health security and sovereignty. At the Gavi Board meeting on June 7th, the Director General of Africa CDC, H.E. Dr Jean Kaseya, underscored the importance of respectful partnership and collaboration, stating, “Local manufacturing is the second independence of Africa because it impacts our health security and economic growth.\nAdditionally, Africa CDC will spearhead the Lusaka agenda to strengthen national leadership and partner coordination for effective implementation of the One Plan, One Budget, and One M&E Framework.\n“In recognition of AVMA’s significance to Africa, Dr. Kaseya announced that the popular launch of AVMA will occur on African soil in the coming weeks. This momentous occasion will bring together African leaders, Gavi, donors and partners, African Civil Society Organizations, and communities to reflect on and celebrate the journey toward Africa’s self-reliance in manufacturing vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.Together, we stand on the brink of a new era for Africa’s self-reliance in health security, driven by innovation, partnership, and a shared vision for a safer, healthier, and more prosperous Africa.\nAbout Africa CDC:\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (AfricaCDC) is the African Union’s continental autonomous public health agency that supports member states in strengthening health systems and improving surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

    "content": "Senegal, WHO launch regional emergency hub to bolster Africa’s response to health crises | WHO | Regional Office for Africa\nSkip to main content\nWHO Africa\nSenegal, WHO launch regional emergency hub to bolster Africa’s response to health crises\nSenegal, WHO launch regional emergency hub to bolster Africa’s response to health crises\n14 December 2023\nDakar –\nThe Government of Senegal and World Health Organization (WHO) today inaugurated a regional health emergency hub in the Senegalese capital Dakar to further bolster the African region’s capacity to respond swiftly and effectively to health crises and save lives.\nBuilding on the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO in Africa has over the past two years worked closely with countries in the region to establish decentralized emergency response systems to ensure an effective response to health crises. Under a transformative initiative, the Organization has embarked on a mission to establish three emergency hubs in the region.\nThe WHO Regional Emergency Hub in Dakar launched today is the second of its kind after WHO and the Government of Kenya launched the Nairobi health emergency hub in 2022. A health emergency hub in Pretoria is planned to be launched in 2024.\n“This hub, with its various functions that include strategic pre-positioning of emergency health supplies, will enable the WHO Regional Office for Africa to support countries affected by health or humanitarian crises respond faster and in a more structured manner,” said Amadou Ba, Prime Minister of Senegal.\nThe African region faces the highest number of health emergencies globally each year. As of November 2023, the region was grappling with more than 130 disease outbreaks. In West Africa’s Sahel region, more than 33 million people across six countries currently require urgent need of life-saving humanitarian assistance.\nThe goal of the regional emergency hubs is to substantially reduce – from an average of 45 days previously to three days – the time it takes to deliver life-saving, effective emergency response to countries after a public health event has been declared. This is critical to make meaningful difference in the plight of people affected by crises and to effectively control and end disease outbreaks.\nThe health emergency hubs also serve as centres of excellence, aiming to train more than 3000 African experts, equipping them with key technical skills essential for effective response to health emergencies. Each of the three centres has a specialized function, capitalizing on the comparative advantages afforded by each host country.\n“I extend my heartfelt appreciation to all those who have contributed to establishing this essential facility,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Our work through this hub aligns with the current global dynamic towards emergency preparedness, vaccine manufacturing, supply chain and effective tools to better respond to public health crises.”\nThe Senegal hub specializes in supply chain management, data analysis, innovation and information management, the Kenya hub focuses on the development of emergency medical personnel, while that in south Africa specializes on research and development, and genomic surveillance.\nSince September 2022 when the temporary warehouse in Nairobi became operational the delivery time of critical emergency health supplies and equipment within the region has drastically reduced from at least three weeks to an average of three days. The deployment of responders has also been reduced.\nThe Government of Senegal has allocated five hectares of land for the construction of the Regional Emergency Hub in the outskirts of Dakar. The 8000-square-metre building has a 100-person office space. Additionally, the government has allocated 5000-square-metre container yard and is facilitating speedy custom clearance processes for inbound and outbound supplies.\nThe hubs in Kenya and Senegal feature a warehouse for prepositioning medical supplies and equipment, a state-of-the-art training facility, an infectious diseases unit, an emergency response simulation facility and a training camp for health emergency first responders.\nThe Regional Emergency Hubs will work in close cooperation with partners and the broader United Nations ecosystem to support countries. WHO is also collaborating closely with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)",

This initiative will provide financial incentives to help vaccine manufacturers in Africa scale up production and become sustainable on a long-term basis.\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance, launched its replenishment campaign asking for $9 billion in new pledges, out of a total need of $11.9 billion, with $2.9 billion available in existing donor pledges, investment income, and leftover resources from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gavi has received $2.4 billion in new pledges, with $1.58 billion of that coming from the United States.\n“Today is a great day for Africa, thanks to this event,” said Dr. Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC Director General, at the event. “This financing will continue to reduce the gap and increase fairness and equity,” he said. “We are launching AVMA today, which will allow us, between now and 2040, to produce 60% of our vaccines,” Dr. Kaseya added.\nHe also announced that Africa will organize a launching ceremony of AVMA in Africa for African leaders, partners, non-governmental organizations, and community organizations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to ensure regional diversification of vaccine manufacturing. A lack of local manufacturing capacity in Africa and other parts of the world meant that the African continent had to wait longer for vaccines to become available. “Our vision is not restricted to only producing vaccines locally but also covers the production of drugs, diagnostics, and other healing products,” Dr. Kaseya said.\n“With our Alliance on track to meet almost all of the goals we set for 2025, we need also to consider how we can accelerate our progress and broaden the protection we can provide to populations for the rest of this decade,” said Professor José Manuel Barroso, Chair of the Board of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “As Gavi sets these ambitious goals, I am grateful for the leadership of France, the African Union, and Africa CDC as we make the case for investing in immunization and strengthening global health security.”\nMeanwhile, on the sidelines of the Global Forum for Vaccine Sovereignty and Innovation in Paris, France, the Africa CDC and African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) renewed their partnership with a new cooperation agreement announced on 20 June. Through this collaboration, Afreximbank committed a USD 2 billion facility to the “Africa Health Security Investment Plan” to support the health product manufacturing ambition of the continent. This initiative will focus on the African Pooled Procurement Mechanism (APPM) and the Platform for Harmonized African Health Products Manufacturing (PHAHM). It also intends to complement GAVI’s innovative financing mechanism, the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), which is set to provide up to USD 1 billion in financing to African manufacturers of health and pharmaceutical products over the next ten years.\n28 June 2024\nTheme\nAVMA\n,\nAfrican Vaccine Manufacturing\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

We welcome the opportunity to build synergies with BMFG and other partners in this effort to leverage data in the fight against diseases,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nDiscussions during the engagement centered on the alignment between the vision and strategies of the UCN cluster and the BMGF, and how this can inform the work of the PPHM programme as it works to support and enhance the use of data analytics at both regional and country level.\nFurthermore, the WHO Africa Regional Office and BMFG express commitment to continue to work closely, through the UCN Cluster and PPHM, to support the many areas identified for collaboration, with an initial focus on the eradication of malaria in the region.\n“We recognize the need to leverage data for public health decision-making. We are looking forward to building synergies with the WHO Africa Regional Office to support countries in the region in their efforts to use data-informed solutions to fight disease,” says Jennifer Gardy.\nPPH was established as a special strategic initiative to deepen the precision public health for Africa (PPH4Africa) strategic initiative, advancing the deployment of analytics towards health systems strengthening and response. This vision is aligned with ongoing efforts to strengthen capacity on epidemiological modelling for public health decision-making in sub-Saharan Africa, already supported by BMFG.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nNyandoh Paho TADFOR\nCommunication Officer\nRegional Office for Africa\nEmail:\nnyandoht\n[at]\nwho.int\n(nyandoht[at]who[dot]int)",

This decision by the Board of Gavi will contribute significantly to saving lives and livelihoods,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nAt the 2023 WHO Africa Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group (RITAG) and the Immunization Stakeholders meeting, experts shared their commitment to advance efforts toward the attainment of global immunization. Therefore, through  WHO’s coordination role, the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF), which facilitated the regulatory environment required for COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the RITAG have been positioned and ready to support these commitments by Gavi for a deepened outcome.\nThe WHO Regional Office for Africa also welcomes the decision by  Gavi to translate lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic into concrete public health interventions, with a US$ 500 million investment to ensure the availability of funds for a future pandemic.\nThe lessons learned from decades of fighting and preventing diseases, including most recently,  COVID-19 have led to the vision and strategies, articulated in WHO Africa Regional Office’s Ending Disease in Africa: vision, strategies and Special Initiatives, 2023-2030, which will drive the work moving forward, including the vital acceleration of immunization uptake across the region.\nAnchored on this new strategy, WHO has supported countries in Africa in the development of innovative country plans to catch up with children who missed routine immunization.\nThis new strategy aligns with Gavi’s focus on protecting the next generation — particularly zero-dose children — through strengthening regional and country capacities on immunization and other diagnostics and therapeutics.\n“For us as WHO, serving about a billion people in 47 African countries, we welcome the opportunity to strengthen our ongoing collaboration with Gavi, Africa CDC and other partners to translate this latest commitment into action towards ending diseases in Africa,” Dr Moeti said.\nFor more information on the fight against diseases in Africa, see related links.\nEnding diseases in Africa\nStatus of Immunization in Africa\nThe roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa\nCountry Profiles on Immunization Coverage in the African Region\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nSayibu Ibrahim Suhuyini\nCommunications Officer\nWHO Ghana Country Office\nEmail:\nsayibui\n[at]\nwho.int\n(sayibui[at]who[dot]int)\nTel: +233 25 795 7942\nNyandoh Paho TADFOR\nCommunication Officer\nRegional Office for Africa\nEmail:\nnyandoht\n[at]\nwho.int\n(nyandoht[at]who[dot]int)",
