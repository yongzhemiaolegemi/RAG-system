products represent strategic pillars of the health and security agenda for the African continent. African leaders pledge to increase the share of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics locally manufactured in Africa to 60% by 2040. This vision will be achieved by establishing a sustainable vaccine development and manufacturing ecosystem underpinned by research and development, intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer, robust regulatory systems, innovative and sustainable financing, strategic partnerships, and commitment by African and global procurement agencies to purchase vaccines produced on the continent.\nSince the late 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided a safety, quality, and efficacy assurance assessment process, now known as “WHO prequalification” (PQ), to ensure vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and other health products supplied by procurement agencies meet acceptable standards and to facilitate the regulatory review and uptake of health products in Iow-resource settings.\nIn Africa, the slow process of WHO PQ was seen as one of the key limitations on the way to achieving the local manufacturing agenda. In this context, Africa CDC welcomes the new\nWHO policy\nto initiate parallel processes both for recommendation guidelines and PQ or Emergency Use Listing Procedure (EUL) assessment as an important step in addressing the inequity in rapidly accessing essential and innovative health products. The use of interim guidelines, especially for innovator products, will be useful in accelerating timelines. Nevertheless, they require significant efforts to address the high data and evidence standards, know how to produce a complete dossier for submission and interact with PQ’s consultation processes.\nOne of the critical and intrinsic factors for sustainable manufacturing in Africa is ensuring that African manufacturers have access to efficient and harmonized regulatory pathways that ensure high-quality products and market access for African-made products. The acquisition of maturity level 3 (ML3) status in five (5) African countries, coupled with ongoing competency programs through Regional Centres for Regulatory Excellence (RCOREs), underscores the critical importance for African regulatory experts to possess expertise and capabilities that align with adequate regulatory oversight across the entire lifecycle of vaccine production.\nLengthy and fragmented processes to acquire regulatory approval will lead to late market access and financial and administrative burdens for African manufacturers. In addressing this,\nachieving WHO prequalification to enter the United Nations (UN) procurement system\nis particularly important for African manufacturers to reach the economics of scales necessary to foster a conducive manufacturing eco-system, including Research and Development. We encourage WHO to continue to support the strengthening of these important activities and engagement and communication across diverse stakeholder communities. Africa CDC will continue to monitor the progress and execution of these and similar recommendations for the benefits of local manufacturing of pharmaceutical products in Africa.\n3 April 2024\nTheme\nRespectful Partnership\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

health products represent strategic pillars of the health and security agenda for the African continent. African leaders pledge to increase the share of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics locally manufactured in Africa to 60% by 2040. This vision will be achieved by establishing a sustainable vaccine development and manufacturing ecosystem underpinned by research and development, intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer, robust regulatory systems, innovative and sustainable financing, strategic partnerships, and commitment by African and global procurement agencies to purchase vaccines produced on the continent.\\nSince the late 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided a safety, quality, and efficacy assurance assessment process, now known as “WHO prequalification” (PQ), to ensure vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and other health products supplied by procurement agencies meet acceptable standards and to facilitate the regulatory review and uptake of health products in Iow-resource settings.\\nIn Africa, the slow process of WHO PQ was seen as one of the key limitations on the way to achieving the local manufacturing agenda. In this context, Africa CDC welcomes the new\\nWHO policy\\nto initiate parallel processes both for recommendation guidelines and PQ or Emergency Use Listing Procedure (EUL) assessment as an important step in addressing the inequity in rapidly accessing essential and innovative health products. The use of interim guidelines, especially for innovator products, will be useful in accelerating timelines. Nevertheless, they require significant efforts to address the high data and evidence standards, know how to produce a complete dossier for submission and interact with PQ’s consultation processes.\\nOne of the critical and intrinsic factors for sustainable manufacturing in Africa is ensuring that African manufacturers have access to efficient and harmonized regulatory pathways that ensure high-quality products and market access for African-made products. The acquisition of maturity level 3 (ML3) status in five (5) African countries, coupled with ongoing competency programs through Regional Centres for Regulatory Excellence (RCOREs), underscores the critical importance for African regulatory experts to possess expertise and capabilities that align with adequate regulatory oversight across the entire lifecycle of vaccine production.\\nLengthy and fragmented processes to acquire regulatory approval will lead to late market access and financial and administrative burdens for African manufacturers. In addressing this,\\nachieving WHO prequalification to enter the United Nations (UN) procurement system\\nis particularly important for African manufacturers to reach the economics of scales necessary to foster a conducive manufacturing eco-system, including Research and Development. We encourage WHO to continue to support the strengthening of these important activities and engagement and communication across diverse stakeholder communities. Africa CDC will continue to monitor the progress and execution of these and similar recommendations for the benefits of local manufacturing of pharmaceutical products in Africa.\\n3 April 2024\\nTheme\\nRespectful Partnership\\nRegion\\nCentral Africa\\n,\\nEastern Africa\\n,\\nNorthern Africa\\n,\\nSouthern Africa\\n,\\nWestern Africa\\nRelated Content\\nMedia Advisory\\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\\nPress Releases\\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\\nPress Releases\\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\\nFollow Us\\nTwitter\\nLinkedin\\nFacebook-f\\nYoutube\\nFlickr\\nInstagram\\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Systems\nNairobi, Kenya. July 25, 2024\n– The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and Africa Public Health Foundation (APHF) have signed an agreement to support strengthening health systems in Africa Union Member States.\nAPHF was established to enable investments in public health activities that support Africa CDC’s goals and objectives across the continent. It’s main operational vectors include resource mobilisation, grants management, advocacy for improved policies, private sector engagement and contributing to the analysis of public health data.\nH.E. Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of Africa CDC, remarked, “Africa CDC’s strategic plan 2023-2027 is ambitious, aiming to achieve significant outcomes for the continent. The Africa Public Health Foundation is pivotal in facilitating resource mobilisation for Africa CDC, enhancing public health systems across African Union Member States, and supporting the implementation of The New Public Health Order.”\nAPHF supports the Africa CDC New Public Health Order in its mission to build a healthier and more prosperous Africa.\nDr. Bernard Haufiku, APHF Governing Council Chair and Founder, states, “I am excited about this special day as we have been looking forward to this momentous occasion on which we sign the Agreement between APHF and Africa CDC. Our strategic partnership has benefited the continent through resource mobilisation to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ebola, Marburg, and Cholera outbreaks, and related interventions. I am grateful to Africa CDC for the support over the years since we started working in 2020 and the great work we have done together.”\nThe Agreement outlines the collaboration modalities between the two institutions, with the priority areas articulated in the Africa CDC strategy as a reference. These include strengthening public health institutions and the workforce, expanding local manufacturing of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics, and building partnerships with critical stakeholders within the broader health ecosystem.\nThis Agreement consolidates the joint work that has yielded several achievements, taking it to the next level now that we have moved from the emergency response to address the challenges the continent still faces holistically and from a longer term- perspective.\nAfrica CDC and APHF Forge Strategic Partnership to Strengthen Health Systems\nDownload\n*** END ***\nNote to the Editors\nAbout the Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nPress Releases\nAfrica CDC and CEPI deepen partnership to fortify African preparedness against disease outbreaks\nMay 28, 2024; Geneva, Switzerland:\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the sidelines of the 77th World Health Assembly to expand their partnership to strengthen epidemic and pandemic prevention, preparedness and response in Africa.\nUnited by a shared mission, the organizations will collaborate to boost regional vaccine research, development, and sustainable manufacturing leadership and capabilities in Africa, fostering a faster and more equitable response to emerging infectious diseases.\n“The New Public Health Order calls to action to build resilient health systems capable of managing recurrent, high-impact infectious disease and outbreaks; an action-oriented partnership such as this is at the core,” said\nDr. Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC’s Director General\n. “This collaboration with CEPI in research, clinical trials, and local manufacturing of medical countermeasures will elevate Africa’s readiness against outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics, thus consolidating the continent’s preparedness far beyond where we were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n“African leadership and capabilities will be key for ensuring the continent can respond to increasingly frequent infectious disease outbreaks,” said\nRichard Hatchett, CEPI’s Chief Executive Officer.\n“The preparatory work to manage these outbreaks—from greater vaccine manufacturing capacity to clinical trial readiness—must be undertaken now. CEPI stands ready to support Africa CDC in the realisation of these goals and to further strengthen Africa’s preparedness and resilience against future outbreaks.”\nIn line with the African Union’s (A.U.) ambition to produce 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs in Africa by 2040 under the Africa CDC’s Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM);  the expanded partnership will ultimately focus its efforts on enhancing research and development, building a workforce as well as supply chain optimization to support resilient health systems This ambition will increase vaccine sovereignty and reduce external reliance, helping prevent a recurrence of the vaccine inequity seen during the COVID-19 response in Africa.\nTo boost vaccine accessibility and efficiency and meet this goal, there is a need to invest in vaccine R&D and manufacturing innovations, amongst others, and build a resilient regional supply chain. To that end, Africa CDC and CEPI will coordinate to fund innovations accelerating speed, scale, or accessibility for initial implementation with African manufacturers. This investment will support sustainable manufacturing for routine vaccinations in Africa, and—in the event of an outbreak—these facilities can be mobilized to produce response vaccines promptly.\nIn alignment with Africa CDC, the partnership also aims to bolster Africa’s research ecosystem and clinical trial infrastructure, including targeted capacity strengthening through CEPI’s\nResearch Preparedness Program\n—which, directed by regional experts, aims to build capacity for conducting high-quality Phase 3 efficacy trials.\nBuilding on existing clinical trial capability in some African countries is vital as vaccine candidates against endemic diseases, such as\nLassa fever\n, progress into late-stage development. Phase 3 trials provide essential data required for vaccine approval and must take place in regions where the disease is prevalent. A\nCEPI-funded Phase 2 trial for a Lassa fever vaccine\ncandidate is already underway; it is crucial that if this candidate, or another, is successful, there is regional capability to further its path toward licensure. Once established, this capability can benefit other regional actors advancing to late-stage research.\nThe organizations will also collaborate to enhance vaccine safety protocols, biosecurity, pathogen surveillance, investment in capacity building, and other areas that help ensure overall African readiness for emergency vaccine responses.\nAfrica CDC and CEPI are committed to this cooperation, which will strengthen collaboration and deliver tangible results to deliver Africa’s long-term health security ambitions.\n—END\n—\nNotes to Editors\nAbout CEPI\nCEPI was launched in 2017 as an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civil organisations. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic disease threats and enable equitable access to them. CEPI has supported the development of more than 50 vaccine candidates or platform technologies against multiple known high-risk pathogens and is also advancing the development of rapid response platforms for vaccines against a future Disease X. Central to CEPI’s pandemic-beating five-year plan for 2022-2026 is the ‘100 Days Mission’ to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days.\nAbout Africa CDC\nAbout Africa CDC: The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

content\\nEmail:\\ncommunications@africacdc.org\\nSearch\\nSearch\\nNews\\n/\\nPress Releases\\nAfrica CDC and CEPI deepen partnership to fortify African preparedness against disease outbreaks\\nMay 28, 2024; Geneva, Switzerland:\\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the sidelines of the 77th World Health Assembly to expand their partnership to strengthen epidemic and pandemic prevention, preparedness and response in Africa.\\nUnited by a shared mission, the organizations will collaborate to boost regional vaccine research, development, and sustainable manufacturing leadership and capabilities in Africa, fostering a faster and more equitable response to emerging infectious diseases.\\n“The New Public Health Order calls to action to build resilient health systems capable of managing recurrent, high-impact infectious disease and outbreaks; an action-oriented partnership such as this is at the core,” said\\nDr. Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC’s Director General\\n. “This collaboration with CEPI in research, clinical trials, and local manufacturing of medical countermeasures will elevate Africa’s readiness against outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics, thus consolidating the continent’s preparedness far beyond where we were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.”\\n“African leadership and capabilities will be key for ensuring the continent can respond to increasingly frequent infectious disease outbreaks,” said\\nRichard Hatchett, CEPI’s Chief Executive Officer.\\n“The preparatory work to manage these outbreaks—from greater vaccine manufacturing capacity to clinical trial readiness—must be undertaken now. CEPI stands ready to support Africa CDC in the realisation of these goals and to further strengthen Africa’s preparedness and resilience against future outbreaks.”\\nIn line with the African Union’s (A.U.) ambition to produce 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs in Africa by 2040 under the Africa CDC’s Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM);  the expanded partnership will ultimately focus its efforts on enhancing research and development, building a workforce as well as supply chain optimization to support resilient health systems This ambition will increase vaccine sovereignty and reduce external reliance, helping prevent a recurrence of the vaccine inequity seen during the COVID-19 response in Africa.\\nTo boost vaccine accessibility and efficiency and meet this goal, there is a need to invest in vaccine R&D and manufacturing innovations, amongst others, and build a resilient regional supply chain. To that end, Africa CDC and CEPI will coordinate to fund innovations accelerating speed, scale, or accessibility for initial implementation with African manufacturers. This investment will support sustainable manufacturing for routine vaccinations in Africa, and—in the event of an outbreak—these facilities can be mobilized to produce response vaccines promptly.\\nIn alignment with Africa CDC, the partnership also aims to bolster Africa’s research ecosystem and clinical trial infrastructure, including targeted capacity strengthening through CEPI’s\\nResearch Preparedness Program\\n—which, directed by regional experts, aims to build capacity for conducting high-quality Phase 3 efficacy trials.\\nBuilding on existing clinical trial capability in some African countries is vital as vaccine candidates against endemic diseases, such as\\nLassa fever\\n, progress into late-stage development. Phase 3 trials provide essential data required for vaccine approval and must take place in regions where the disease is prevalent. A\\nCEPI-funded Phase 2 trial for a Lassa fever vaccine\\ncandidate is already underway; it is crucial that if this candidate, or another, is successful, there is regional capability to further its path toward licensure. Once established, this capability can benefit other regional actors advancing to late-stage research.\\nThe organizations will also collaborate to enhance vaccine safety protocols, biosecurity, pathogen surveillance, investment in capacity building, and other areas that help ensure overall African readiness for emergency vaccine responses.\\nAfrica CDC and CEPI are committed to this cooperation, which will strengthen collaboration and deliver tangible results to deliver Africa’s long-term health security ambitions.\\n—END\\n—\\nNotes to Editors\\nAbout CEPI\\nCEPI was launched in 2017 as an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civil organisations. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic disease threats and enable equitable access to them. CEPI has supported the development of more than 50 vaccine candidates or platform technologies against multiple known high-risk pathogens and is also advancing the development of rapid response platforms for vaccines against a future Disease X. Central to CEPI’s pandemic-beating five-year plan for 2022-2026 is the ‘100 Days Mission’ to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days.\\nAbout Africa CDC\\nAbout Africa CDC: The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

Africa\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the European Union Commission signed an agreement to support access to health products and local manufacturing in Africa as part of the Team Europe Initiative on Manufacturing and Access to Vaccines, Medicines, and Health Technologies. The agreement was signed by H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, and Jutta Urpilainen, European Commissioner for International Partnerships, during the Global Gateway Forum in Brussels on October 25-26. This agreement complements the Team Europe Initiative on Manufacturing and Access to Vaccines, Medicines, and Health Technologies (TEI MAV+) for Africa.\nThe MAV+ initiative of Team Europe partners with African nations to strengthen local pharmaceutical manufacturing. It aims to improve access to quality health products, aligning with UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.8. The Global Gateway Forum brings together global leaders to promote infrastructure investment for Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, the European Union is contributing €134 million to support sustainable implementation of national plans in six African countries, fostering local manufacturing and equitable access to health products. These efforts align with the shared development objectives and geopolitical priorities of both the European Union and the African Union, complementing existing initiatives such as the African Union-European Union Innovation Agenda, the Africa CDC-PAVM Initiative, the EU Global Health Strategy, and Global Gateway.\nJutta Urpilainen, European Commissioner for International Partnerships, stated, “With its Global Health Strategy, the EU is committed to strengthening health systems and securing global chains around the world, while boosting our partners’ strategic autonomy, promoting universal health coverage, and preventing future health emergencies. These additional Global Gateway support measures will bring in more actors from the private sector and civil society. Notably, they provide targeted support to our African partners in building capacities of local production of pharmaceuticals and medical technology.”\nThe key objectives of this initiative encompass skills development through higher education and vocational training, promoting the sustainability of the private sector, fostering local ecosystems, supporting entrepreneurs and SMEs, ensuring quality assurance along national supply chains, facilitating research and development (R&D) for new or improved health products, promoting technology transfer with a focus on local organisations and shared African and European interests, strengthening regulatory processes at the country level in coordination with regional actions involving the European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO, AUDA-NEPAD, and the African Medicines Agency (AMA), driving innovation and digitalisation to enhance access to medicines, and enhancing managerial skills, country leadership, and ownership.\nH.E. Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, expressed, “The signing of this agreement solidifies our shared vision in nurturing a coordinated global response to global public health challenges. This action-oriented partnership aims to advance the New Public Health order and expand local manufacturing in Africa.”\nAbout Africa CDC\n: Africa CDC is an autonomous health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

for Africa\\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the European Union Commission signed an agreement to support access to health products and local manufacturing in Africa as part of the Team Europe Initiative on Manufacturing and Access to Vaccines, Medicines, and Health Technologies. The agreement was signed by H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, and Jutta Urpilainen, European Commissioner for International Partnerships, during the Global Gateway Forum in Brussels on October 25-26. This agreement complements the Team Europe Initiative on Manufacturing and Access to Vaccines, Medicines, and Health Technologies (TEI MAV+) for Africa.\\nThe MAV+ initiative of Team Europe partners with African nations to strengthen local pharmaceutical manufacturing. It aims to improve access to quality health products, aligning with UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.8. The Global Gateway Forum brings together global leaders to promote infrastructure investment for Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, the European Union is contributing €134 million to support sustainable implementation of national plans in six African countries, fostering local manufacturing and equitable access to health products. These efforts align with the shared development objectives and geopolitical priorities of both the European Union and the African Union, complementing existing initiatives such as the African Union-European Union Innovation Agenda, the Africa CDC-PAVM Initiative, the EU Global Health Strategy, and Global Gateway.\\nJutta Urpilainen, European Commissioner for International Partnerships, stated, “With its Global Health Strategy, the EU is committed to strengthening health systems and securing global chains around the world, while boosting our partners’ strategic autonomy, promoting universal health coverage, and preventing future health emergencies. These additional Global Gateway support measures will bring in more actors from the private sector and civil society. Notably, they provide targeted support to our African partners in building capacities of local production of pharmaceuticals and medical technology.”\\nThe key objectives of this initiative encompass skills development through higher education and vocational training, promoting the sustainability of the private sector, fostering local ecosystems, supporting entrepreneurs and SMEs, ensuring quality assurance along national supply chains, facilitating research and development (R&D) for new or improved health products, promoting technology transfer with a focus on local organisations and shared African and European interests, strengthening regulatory processes at the country level in coordination with regional actions involving the European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO, AUDA-NEPAD, and the African Medicines Agency (AMA), driving innovation and digitalisation to enhance access to medicines, and enhancing managerial skills, country leadership, and ownership.\\nH.E. Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, expressed, “The signing of this agreement solidifies our shared vision in nurturing a coordinated global response to global public health challenges. This action-oriented partnership aims to advance the New Public Health order and expand local manufacturing in Africa.”\\nAbout Africa CDC\\n: Africa CDC is an autonomous health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

September 2023, Addis Ababa\n– The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the government of France signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) today to strengthen their cooperation in public health. The MoU was signed by H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, and Rémi Maréchaux, Ambassador of France to Ethiopia, at a ceremony held at the Africa CDC Secretariat Offices in Addis Ababa.\nThe MoU aims to strengthen Africa CDC’s efforts to build more robust public health systems and improve health security across the continent. Key areas of collaboration under the MoU include strengthening Africa CDC’s capacity; supporting the development of national public health institutes; enhancing disease surveillance and emergency response capacities; promoting local manufacturing of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics; supporting workforce training; and fostering research partnerships between French and African institutions.\n“The signing of this MoU solidifies our shared vision in nurturing a coordinated global response to global public health challenges. This action-oriented framework aims to advance the New Public Health order, enhance health workforce development, and strengthen public health systems for the benefit of all African citizens,” said H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya at the signing ceremony.\nThis MoU builds on France’s longstanding support for public health in Africa. France played a leading role in launching the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator and has donated 10 million vaccine doses to the AVAT mechanism and 48 million doses to 40 African states, mainly through the COVAX initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. The French Development Agency provided a €50 million line of credit to Afreximbank for the AVAT payment facility, enabling vaccine purchases by Uganda, Burundi, DRC and Egypt. The AFD has committed over €500 million to health programs in Africa through its ” Santé en Commun ” (Health in Common) initiative. France also provides technical expertise to Africa CDC in infection, prevention and control (IPC) and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH).\nFrance is a major contributor to Team Europe Initiatives that align with Africa CDC’s priorities, like strengthening pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity on the continent with over €70 million mobilized so far. France also supports regional health projects in West and Central Africa that reinforce Africa CDC’s diagnostics, surveillance, and regulation objectives.\nThe signing of this MoU signals France and Africa CDC’s continued commitment to mutually tackling major public health challenges in the  interest of public health, safety, and security of all African citizens,”\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\nMikaele THOMAS\nPress department at the French Embassy Tél : 01 11 40 00 25 Mél : Mikaele.thomas@diplomatie.gouv.fr\nPO Box 1464, Addis-Ababa Yeka   Kebele : 01102, Addis Abeba\nDorothy Njagi\n| Senior Communication Officer- Policy, Health Diplomacy & Communication | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: email:\nnjagid@africa-union.org\n| Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nAbout Africa CDC\n: Africa CDC is an autonomous health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

Africa\\n11 September 2023, Addis Ababa\\n– The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the government of France signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) today to strengthen their cooperation in public health. The MoU was signed by H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, and Rémi Maréchaux, Ambassador of France to Ethiopia, at a ceremony held at the Africa CDC Secretariat Offices in Addis Ababa.\\nThe MoU aims to strengthen Africa CDC’s efforts to build more robust public health systems and improve health security across the continent. Key areas of collaboration under the MoU include strengthening Africa CDC’s capacity; supporting the development of national public health institutes; enhancing disease surveillance and emergency response capacities; promoting local manufacturing of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics; supporting workforce training; and fostering research partnerships between French and African institutions.\\n“The signing of this MoU solidifies our shared vision in nurturing a coordinated global response to global public health challenges. This action-oriented framework aims to advance the New Public Health order, enhance health workforce development, and strengthen public health systems for the benefit of all African citizens,” said H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya at the signing ceremony.\\nThis MoU builds on France’s longstanding support for public health in Africa. France played a leading role in launching the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator and has donated 10 million vaccine doses to the AVAT mechanism and 48 million doses to 40 African states, mainly through the COVAX initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. The French Development Agency provided a €50 million line of credit to Afreximbank for the AVAT payment facility, enabling vaccine purchases by Uganda, Burundi, DRC and Egypt. The AFD has committed over €500 million to health programs in Africa through its ” Santé en Commun ” (Health in Common) initiative. France also provides technical expertise to Africa CDC in infection, prevention and control (IPC) and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH).\\nFrance is a major contributor to Team Europe Initiatives that align with Africa CDC’s priorities, like strengthening pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity on the continent with over €70 million mobilized so far. France also supports regional health projects in West and Central Africa that reinforce Africa CDC’s diagnostics, surveillance, and regulation objectives.\\nThe signing of this MoU signals France and Africa CDC’s continued commitment to mutually tackling major public health challenges in the  interest of public health, safety, and security of all African citizens,”\\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\\nMikaele THOMAS\\nPress department at the French Embassy Tél : 01 11 40 00 25 Mél : Mikaele.thomas@diplomatie.gouv.fr\\nPO Box 1464, Addis-Ababa Yeka   Kebele : 01102, Addis Abeba\\nDorothy Njagi\\n| Senior Communication Officer- Policy, Health Diplomacy & Communication | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: email:\\nnjagid@africa-union.org\\n| Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\\nFacebook\\n|\\nTwitter\\nAbout Africa CDC\\n: Africa CDC is an autonomous health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

Africa CDC\nSkip to content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nPress Releases\nAfrica CDC and Mastercard Foundation launch phase 2 of the Saving Lives and Livelihoods (SLL) initiative to strengthen Africa’s public health systems\nNovember 28, 2023,\nLusaka\n– The Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation have entered a new phase of their partnership on the Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative in the aftermath of WHO’s declaration of the end of COVID-19 pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative, a bold and unprecedented $1.5 billion partnership, was launched in June 2021. This innovative and ground-breaking partnership aimed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, roll out vaccinations, build the vaccine manufacturing workforce for the continent, and strengthen the Africa CDC to ensure long-term health security for Africa.\nUnprecedented in scale, speed and inclusion of African organisations, the partnership has\ncontributed to the continent’s current vaccination rate of 53 per cent of\nthe target population, up from just 3 per cent at the start of the initiative. The partnership has also trained, equipped, and deployed 38,000 health workers, creating a robust frontline in safeguarding public health locally. It has provided job opportunities for 23,000 individuals and integrated over 600 COVID-19 vaccination centres into healthcare systems. Additionally, this initiative led to the expansion of genomic testing capabilities from seven to 40 laboratories across the continent.\nThe review of Phase 1 of this initiative, among fifteen implementing partners across 29 countries, conducted by Deloitte, indicates that the vast majority of funds disbursed were used effectively and as intended. Likewise, ongoing monitoring by KPMG has confirmed that partners not only showed strength in programmatic results but also improved the institutional capacity for greater sustainability and institutional resilience.\n“Our Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative with the Mastercard Foundation has shown the power of respectful and action-oriented partnerships rooted in collaboration, coordination and systems strengthening. The experience and learnings from Phase I will enable us to move with greater speed and scale to deliver with accelerated impact to our member states” said\nDr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC\n.\nIn its second phase, the partnership will expand its scope and scale, focusing on completing the vaccination of healthcare workers and vulnerable groups, building a robust workforce of community health workers, ensuring pandemic preparedness by bolstering national public health institutions, laboratory capacities, data access and quality, local manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, and continuing strengthening of Africa CDC.\n“While the global pandemic may be declared over, the need to continue investing in our health systems, build our workforce and prepare for future pandemics remains urgent. This partnership will ensure that we have strong health institutions and systems. We aim to enable thousands of young people to build their careers in healthcare and contribute to improving lives in Africa,” said\nReeta Roy, President, and CEO of the Mastercard Foundation.\nThe Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative stands out as a testament to the power of African-led health solutions. As it progresses to its next phase, partnerships will continue to play a crucial role in shaping a New Public Health Order for Africa. Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation remain committed to improving the health and well-being of all Africans.\n-ENDS-\nAbout the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\nAfrica CDC is a continental autonomous health agency of the African Union established to support public health initiatives of Member States and strengthen the capacity of their public health institutions to detect, prevent, control, and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats.

– Africa CDC\\nSkip to content\\nEmail:\\ncommunications@africacdc.org\\nSearch\\nSearch\\nNews\\n/\\nPress Releases\\nAfrica CDC and Mastercard Foundation launch phase 2 of the Saving Lives and Livelihoods (SLL) initiative to strengthen Africa’s public health systems\\nNovember 28, 2023,\\nLusaka\\n– The Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation have entered a new phase of their partnership on the Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative in the aftermath of WHO’s declaration of the end of COVID-19 pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative, a bold and unprecedented $1.5 billion partnership, was launched in June 2021. This innovative and ground-breaking partnership aimed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, roll out vaccinations, build the vaccine manufacturing workforce for the continent, and strengthen the Africa CDC to ensure long-term health security for Africa.\\nUnprecedented in scale, speed and inclusion of African organisations, the partnership has\\ncontributed to the continent’s current vaccination rate of 53 per cent of\\nthe target population, up from just 3 per cent at the start of the initiative. The partnership has also trained, equipped, and deployed 38,000 health workers, creating a robust frontline in safeguarding public health locally. It has provided job opportunities for 23,000 individuals and integrated over 600 COVID-19 vaccination centres into healthcare systems. Additionally, this initiative led to the expansion of genomic testing capabilities from seven to 40 laboratories across the continent.\\nThe review of Phase 1 of this initiative, among fifteen implementing partners across 29 countries, conducted by Deloitte, indicates that the vast majority of funds disbursed were used effectively and as intended. Likewise, ongoing monitoring by KPMG has confirmed that partners not only showed strength in programmatic results but also improved the institutional capacity for greater sustainability and institutional resilience.\\n“Our Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative with the Mastercard Foundation has shown the power of respectful and action-oriented partnerships rooted in collaboration, coordination and systems strengthening. The experience and learnings from Phase I will enable us to move with greater speed and scale to deliver with accelerated impact to our member states” said\\nDr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC\\n.\\nIn its second phase, the partnership will expand its scope and scale, focusing on completing the vaccination of healthcare workers and vulnerable groups, building a robust workforce of community health workers, ensuring pandemic preparedness by bolstering national public health institutions, laboratory capacities, data access and quality, local manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, and continuing strengthening of Africa CDC.\\n“While the global pandemic may be declared over, the need to continue investing in our health systems, build our workforce and prepare for future pandemics remains urgent. This partnership will ensure that we have strong health institutions and systems. We aim to enable thousands of young people to build their careers in healthcare and contribute to improving lives in Africa,” said\\nReeta Roy, President, and CEO of the Mastercard Foundation.\\nThe Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative stands out as a testament to the power of African-led health solutions. As it progresses to its next phase, partnerships will continue to play a crucial role in shaping a New Public Health Order for Africa. Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation remain committed to improving the health and well-being of all Africans.\\n-ENDS-\\nAbout the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\\nAfrica CDC is a continental autonomous health agency of the African Union established to support public health initiatives of Member States and strengthen the capacity of their public health institutions to detect, prevent, control, and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats.

content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nPress Releases\nAfrica CDC and UNICEF Expand Partnership to Strengthen Health Systems and Immunization of Children in Africa\nAddis Ababa | NewYork, 29 February 2024 –\nToday, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and UNICEF announced an extended partnership dedicated to strengthening primary healthcare, supply chain management, pooled procurement and local manufacturing, and emergency response. The collaboration builds on the 2022-2024 Partnership Framework Agreement between Africa CDC and UNICEF, which aims to achieve the goals outlined in the African Union Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership is expected to have a significant impact on public health in Africa by strengthening procurement and supply chain systems, with a particular focus on immunisation for children across the continent.\nH.E Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of Africa CDC, and Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations, signed the expanded partnership agreement in Addis Ababa.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of many healthcare systems and highlighted deficiencies and challenges in medical supply chains. While countries with strong primary healthcare systems were better able to cope, the disruption caused by the pandemic left others facing shortages of vital medical commodities. Over the next four years, Africa CDC and UNICEF will work together to establish robust institutional backing for supply chain management and enhance pooled procurement mechanisms to fortify Africa’s healthcare infrastructure, ensuring timely and adequate access to essential medical supplies for its population.\nH.E Jean Kaseya expressed his pride in the partnership with UNICEF, stating that their shared commitments will enhance primary healthcare and strengthen Africa’s health security. ‘‘The partnership will optimise supply chain management, operationalise the pool procurement mechanism for Africa CDC, empower community health workers, and advance local manufacturing. Ultimately, these efforts will strengthen immunisation systems and reduce outbreaks and epidemics on the continent’’, he says.\nImmunisation is one of the most effective public health interventions globally. However, millions of children in Africa are still deprived of life-saving vaccinations.\nUNICEF’s The State of the World’s Children\n2023: For Every Child\n, Vaccination report revealed that 12.7 million children were under-vaccinated in 2021, including 8.7 million who did not receive a single dose, also called “zero-dose” children.\n“This partnership is a commitment to the well-being of children and their families, affirming their right to health. By strengthening our partnership with Africa CDC and the Joint Emergency Action Plan for Africa, we can ensure communities get the support they need without delay,” said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations. “The push forward on paid and protected community health workers, medical supplies made in Africa, for Africans, remains one of our highest priorities.”\nDuring the past two years, UNICEF and Africa CDC have achieved significant milestones in strengthening Africa CDC’s institutional capacity and catalysing community health programmes, immunisation systems, emergency response, and supply chain enhancement. Collaborative efforts secured the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses and essential cold chain equipment for routine immunisation. Joint high-level advocacy initiatives focused on immunisation, community health, and response to public health emergencies.\nAfrica imports 99% of its vaccines and 70 to 90% of its medicines and medical devices, which is a significant challenge. Africa CDC aims to achieve sustainable production and supply of essential health commodities through African manufacturers, considered Africa’s second independence by Africa CDC. Africa CDC’s goal is to work with African Union Member States and partners to actively advocate for and support the procurement of vaccines made in Africa and prioritise initiatives that strengthen local manufacturing.\nThrough the Partnership for Vaccine Manufacturing, Africa CDC aims to manufacture 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs by 2040, paving the way toward robust and self-reliant health systems, ensuring that people can obtain and use health commodities when and where required.\nThe expanded partnership between Africa CDC and UNICEF signifies a concerted effort to address Africa’s pressing health challenges. By prioritising immunisation, strengthening health systems, and promoting local production, both organisations are poised to make tangible and sustainable impacts on the health and well-being of children and communities across the continent while safeguarding Africa’s health security.\n#  #\nAbout the Partnership\nThe Africa CDC and UNICEF Partnership Framework Agreement, commenced in 2022 and extended today to 2027, contributes to the goals and objective of Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership framework outlines three programmatic areas of collaboration: (i) public health emergency preparedness and response; (ii) immunization systems strengthening; and (iii) procurement and supply chain systems strengthening. Under the partnership extension, this collaboration will expand, particularly in the areas of system strengthening for primary health care (including community health and nutrition systems), in supply chain management, regional and pooled procurement, manufacturing and emergency preparedness and response.\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

content\\nEmail:\\ncommunications@africacdc.org\\nSearch\\nSearch\\nNews\\n/\\nPress Releases\\nAfrica CDC and UNICEF Expand Partnership to Strengthen Health Systems and Immunization of Children in Africa\\nAddis Ababa | NewYork, 29 February 2024 –\\nToday, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and UNICEF announced an extended partnership dedicated to strengthening primary healthcare, supply chain management, pooled procurement and local manufacturing, and emergency response. The collaboration builds on the 2022-2024 Partnership Framework Agreement between Africa CDC and UNICEF, which aims to achieve the goals outlined in the African Union Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership is expected to have a significant impact on public health in Africa by strengthening procurement and supply chain systems, with a particular focus on immunisation for children across the continent.\\nH.E Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of Africa CDC, and Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations, signed the expanded partnership agreement in Addis Ababa.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of many healthcare systems and highlighted deficiencies and challenges in medical supply chains. While countries with strong primary healthcare systems were better able to cope, the disruption caused by the pandemic left others facing shortages of vital medical commodities. Over the next four years, Africa CDC and UNICEF will work together to establish robust institutional backing for supply chain management and enhance pooled procurement mechanisms to fortify Africa’s healthcare infrastructure, ensuring timely and adequate access to essential medical supplies for its population.\\nH.E Jean Kaseya expressed his pride in the partnership with UNICEF, stating that their shared commitments will enhance primary healthcare and strengthen Africa’s health security. ‘‘The partnership will optimise supply chain management, operationalise the pool procurement mechanism for Africa CDC, empower community health workers, and advance local manufacturing. Ultimately, these efforts will strengthen immunisation systems and reduce outbreaks and epidemics on the continent’’, he says.\\nImmunisation is one of the most effective public health interventions globally. However, millions of children in Africa are still deprived of life-saving vaccinations.\\nUNICEF’s The State of the World’s Children\\n2023: For Every Child\\n, Vaccination report revealed that 12.7 million children were under-vaccinated in 2021, including 8.7 million who did not receive a single dose, also called “zero-dose” children.\\n“This partnership is a commitment to the well-being of children and their families, affirming their right to health. By strengthening our partnership with Africa CDC and the Joint Emergency Action Plan for Africa, we can ensure communities get the support they need without delay,” said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations. “The push forward on paid and protected community health workers, medical supplies made in Africa, for Africans, remains one of our highest priorities.”\\nDuring the past two years, UNICEF and Africa CDC have achieved significant milestones in strengthening Africa CDC’s institutional capacity and catalysing community health programmes, immunisation systems, emergency response, and supply chain enhancement. Collaborative efforts secured the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses and essential cold chain equipment for routine immunisation. Joint high-level advocacy initiatives focused on immunisation, community health, and response to public health emergencies.\\nAfrica imports 99% of its vaccines and 70 to 90% of its medicines and medical devices, which is a significant challenge. Africa CDC aims to achieve sustainable production and supply of essential health commodities through African manufacturers, considered Africa’s second independence by Africa CDC. Africa CDC’s goal is to work with African Union Member States and partners to actively advocate for and support the procurement of vaccines made in Africa and prioritise initiatives that strengthen local manufacturing.\\nThrough the Partnership for Vaccine Manufacturing, Africa CDC aims to manufacture 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs by 2040, paving the way toward robust and self-reliant health systems, ensuring that people can obtain and use health commodities when and where required.\\nThe expanded partnership between Africa CDC and UNICEF signifies a concerted effort to address Africa’s pressing health challenges. By prioritising immunisation, strengthening health systems, and promoting local production, both organisations are poised to make tangible and sustainable impacts on the health and well-being of children and communities across the continent while safeguarding Africa’s health security.\\n#  #\\nAbout the Partnership\\nThe Africa CDC and UNICEF Partnership Framework Agreement, commenced in 2022 and extended today to 2027, contributes to the goals and objective of Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership framework outlines three programmatic areas of collaboration: (i) public health emergency preparedness and response; (ii) immunization systems strengthening; and (iii) procurement and supply chain systems strengthening. Under the partnership extension, this collaboration will expand, particularly in the areas of system strengthening for primary health care (including community health and nutrition systems), in supply chain management, regional and pooled procurement, manufacturing and emergency preparedness and response.\\nAbout Africa CDC\\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

Africa - AHRO Global Health Research Center\nSkip to content\nAfrica CDC and WHO Launch Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to Strengthen Health Systems and Combat Disease Outbreaks in Africa\nAHRO Global Health Research Center\n-\nAfrica CDC and WHO Launch Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to Strengthen Health Systems and Combat Disease Outbreaks in Africa\n05 Jun\n2023\nBy\nAfhro\nFrom humanitarian crises triggered by conflict to climate-change induced disasters, Africa deals with over 100 disease outbreaks every year. To tackle these challenges, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are pleased to announce the launch of a Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP). This pioneering five-year strategic collaboration will boost emergency preparedness and response efforts throughout Africa and thus ensure disease outbreaks during humanitarian crises and otherwise are managed efficiently.\nThe JEAP underlines the shared vision of Africa’s two leading public health institutions – to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent. The plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives while capitalising on the Africa CDC and WHO’s unique capabilities and resources. Aligned with the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order, WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030), and WHO EMRO’s four-year strategy for the Eastern Mediterranean region to address health emergencies – the JEAP strengthens emergency preparedness and response across six critical areas.\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health. JEAP will bolster our collective efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with the Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nPriority areas of action are strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection; stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations (70% of response activities during emergencies relate to such supply chain measures); and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. Most critically, this ground-breaking collaboration outlines impactful initiatives to be implemented in unison with countries to enhance the continent’s capacity to detect, monitor, and respond swiftly to health emergencies. In a first-of-its kind collaboration, the JEAP serves as a guiding beacon for targeted emergency response interventions and embodies the importance of cross-cutting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and resource mobilisation.\n“Africa CDC is proud to partner for this important continental strategic plan. Joining forces with WHO will significantly improve our ability to safeguard the health of African populations during times of crisis. Together, we will build resilient health systems and ensure a coordinated and effective response to emergencies across the continent,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC.\nIn an inspiring take, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean reiterated, “This visionary collaboration will breathe new life into the efficiency of current coordination mechanisms, strengthen institutions, and ultimately help us deliver quality healthcare services to our communities.”\nThese efforts are galvanising the commitments from governments, health agencies, and stakeholders to strengthen health emergency preparedness, detection, and response efforts. Through collective action and unwavering commitment, we will build resilient systems, enhance capacities, and safeguard the well-being of our communities. This partnership is a testament to our unwavering dedication to a healthier, safer Africa.\nPopular Tags\nWe are thrilled to announce the success of our recent AHRO webinar\nLatest Posts\n£25 Million Multi Clinical Trials Centers established by AHRO Network\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Starts identification of small molecules for some priority pathogens\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Institute to Add Undergraduate Courses to Its Portfolio\nDecember 27, 2024\nAHRO Appoints Five Ambassadors\nDecember 23, 2024\nAHRO Launches “Climate Change and One Health Project”\nDecember 19, 2024\nDr. Aasma Siddiqui Joins AHRO for 6-Month Fellowship\nDecember 19, 2024\nAHRO Courses to Officially Commence in January 2025\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Clinical Research Program Officially Launched\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO joins the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Confer Doctorate Degree to Hajia Hajara Shardow and Barbara Ngomo\nDecember 14, 2024\nAfrica Consultative Summit on Climate Change and One Health Organized by AHRO Center for Academic Research (UK)\nOctober 12, 2024\nPoverty Alleviation in Africa: The Way Forward – A Must-Watch Interview with Princess Nana Yakubu\nSeptember 6, 2024\nAHRO Commences Fellowship program, first cohort in 2025\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO opens five representative offices in West Africa\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Dubai to lead the product development program\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Canada to oversee commercialization and IP activities\nJune 13, 2024\n“AHRO will become one of the leaders in small drug molecules research”- Prof Yaro\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO appoints new Scientific Advisory Board\nJune 13, 2024\n“We are ready”- Dr Christine Nyirahabimana\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO starts its exploratory research activities\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO Starts electing Emeritus Fellows\nJuly 25, 2023\n######################\nOutput:",

Africa - AHRO Global Health Research Center\\nSkip to content\\nAfrica CDC and WHO Launch Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to Strengthen Health Systems and Combat Disease Outbreaks in Africa\\nAHRO Global Health Research Center\\n-\\nAfrica CDC and WHO Launch Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to Strengthen Health Systems and Combat Disease Outbreaks in Africa\\n05 Jun\\n2023\\nBy\\nAfhro\\nFrom humanitarian crises triggered by conflict to climate-change induced disasters, Africa deals with over 100 disease outbreaks every year. To tackle these challenges, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are pleased to announce the launch of a Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP). This pioneering five-year strategic collaboration will boost emergency preparedness and response efforts throughout Africa and thus ensure disease outbreaks during humanitarian crises and otherwise are managed efficiently.\\nThe JEAP underlines the shared vision of Africa’s two leading public health institutions – to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent. The plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives while capitalising on the Africa CDC and WHO’s unique capabilities and resources. Aligned with the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order, WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030), and WHO EMRO’s four-year strategy for the Eastern Mediterranean region to address health emergencies – the JEAP strengthens emergency preparedness and response across six critical areas.\\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health. JEAP will bolster our collective efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with the Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\\nPriority areas of action are strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection; stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations (70% of response activities during emergencies relate to such supply chain measures); and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. Most critically, this ground-breaking collaboration outlines impactful initiatives to be implemented in unison with countries to enhance the continent’s capacity to detect, monitor, and respond swiftly to health emergencies. In a first-of-its kind collaboration, the JEAP serves as a guiding beacon for targeted emergency response interventions and embodies the importance of cross-cutting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and resource mobilisation.\\n“Africa CDC is proud to partner for this important continental strategic plan. Joining forces with WHO will significantly improve our ability to safeguard the health of African populations during times of crisis. Together, we will build resilient health systems and ensure a coordinated and effective response to emergencies across the continent,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC.\\nIn an inspiring take, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean reiterated, “This visionary collaboration will breathe new life into the efficiency of current coordination mechanisms, strengthen institutions, and ultimately help us deliver quality healthcare services to our communities.”\\nThese efforts are galvanising the commitments from governments, health agencies, and stakeholders to strengthen health emergency preparedness, detection, and response efforts. Through collective action and unwavering commitment, we will build resilient systems, enhance capacities, and safeguard the well-being of our communities. This partnership is a testament to our unwavering dedication to a healthier, safer Africa.\\nPopular Tags\\nWe are thrilled to announce the success of our recent AHRO webinar\\nLatest Posts\\n£25 Million Multi Clinical Trials Centers established by AHRO Network\\nJanuary 10, 2025\\nAHRO Starts identification of small molecules for some priority pathogens\\nJanuary 10, 2025\\nAHRO Institute to Add Undergraduate Courses to Its Portfolio\\nDecember 27, 2024\\nAHRO Appoints Five Ambassadors\\nDecember 23, 2024\\nAHRO Launches “Climate Change and One Health Project”\\nDecember 19, 2024\\nDr. Aasma Siddiqui Joins AHRO for 6-Month Fellowship\\nDecember 19, 2024\\nAHRO Courses to Officially Commence in January 2025\\nDecember 14, 2024\\nAHRO Clinical Research Program Officially Launched\\nDecember 14, 2024\\nAHRO joins the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education\\nDecember 14, 2024\\nAHRO Confer Doctorate Degree to Hajia Hajara Shardow and Barbara Ngomo\\nDecember 14, 2024\\nAfrica Consultative Summit on Climate Change and One Health Organized by AHRO Center for Academic Research (UK)\\nOctober 12, 2024\\nPoverty Alleviation in Africa: The Way Forward – A Must-Watch Interview with Princess Nana Yakubu\\nSeptember 6, 2024\\nAHRO Commences Fellowship program, first cohort in 2025\\nJune 13, 2024\\nAHRO opens five representative offices in West Africa\\nJune 13, 2024\\nAHRO-Dubai to lead the product development program\\nJune 13, 2024\\nAHRO-Canada to oversee commercialization and IP activities\\nJune 13, 2024\\n“AHRO will become one of the leaders in small drug molecules research”- Prof Yaro\\nJune 13, 2024\\nAHRO appoints new Scientific Advisory Board\\nJune 13, 2024\\n“We are ready”- Dr Christine Nyirahabimana\\nJuly 25, 2023\\nAHRO starts its exploratory research activities\\nJuly 25, 2023\\nAHRO Starts electing Emeritus Fellows\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Africa CDC\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Africa CDC (Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention) is a leading African public health institution focused on strengthening emergency preparedness, response efforts, and health systems across the African continent.\\\"<|>\\\"From humanitarian crises triggered by conflict to climate-change induced disasters, Africa deals with over 100 disease outbreaks every year...

Ababa, Ethiopia – 24 April 2024\n– The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) kicked-off two groundbreaking projects: the Integrated Genomic Surveillance and Data Sharing Platform (IGS) and Integrated Genomic Surveillance for Outbreak Detection (DETECT). These initiatives, co-funded by the European Union, are poised to fortify the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative (Africa PGI 2.0), enhancing the capacity of member states for molecular detection of outbreaks, AMR genomic surveillance, and timely data sharing across Africa.\nThe kick-off meeting, convened at the Africa CDC Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, signified a pivotal moment in the collaboration between the African CDC and the European Commission Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen outbreak detection and disease surveillance throughout Africa.\nThrough these projects implemented by the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HaDEA), Africa CDC, and HERA, in partnership with African Union (AU) Member States, the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) and the Africa Public Health Foundation (APHF), will strengthen national and regional capacities to promptly detect outbreaks, support the integration of AMR genomic surveillance, and facilitate swift and high-quality data sharing for public health decision-making.\nHis Excellency Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC, emphasized the significance of this partnership stating, “The increasing number of outbreaks is driven by complex ecological, climatic, political, economic, and social factors, all of which are becoming more exacerbated on our continent. These projects are poised to strengthen laboratory detection and surveillance of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic diseases, as well as antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Africa. They also highlight the strategic partnership between Africa CDC and the European Commission.”\nLaurent Muschel, Acting Director General of HERA, emphasized, “In the face of ongoing global health challenges, Africa CDC and HERA are taking together concrete actions to strengthen detection of outbreaks, AMR genomic surveillance, and timely data sharing across Africa. Fortifying multi-pathogen molecular detection and sequencing capabilities in the African Union is essential for global health security.”\nAfrica CDC’s shift towards Africa PGI 2.0 signifies a transition from emergency response to building an optimized, resilient, and integrated molecular diagnostic and genomic surveillance ecosystem. It is critical and timely to incorporate lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, and empower national and regional reference laboratories to expand their capabilities to detect and characterize epidemic and pandemic-prone diseases. As demonstrated in previous outbreaks, molecular detection and genomic sequencing improves early detection and response to public health emergencies. Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, CEO of ASLM, remarked, “The launch of the two projects is pivotal in devising scalable and sustainable approaches for integrating molecular diagnostics and sequencing within Africa’s routine surveillance structures. We are eager to collaborate with the Africa CDC and HERA to strengthen laboratory systems ensuring effective responses to current and future health threats”.\n“APHF will continue to strengthen collaboration with the Africa CDC and HERA to support the flagship Pathogen Genomics Initiative (Africa PGI) and advance public health laboratory systems for pandemic preparedness and response.” Said Dr. Ebere Okereke, CEO of APHF\nThe Africa CDC is working with ASLM, APHF, Member States, the Africa Laboratory Technical Working Group, and other partners to ensure the effective and successful implementation of the two projects.\n# #\nFor more information:\nDr. Sofonias Tessema, Program Lead, Africa PGI |Africa CDC| sofoniast@africacdc.org\nMedia inquiries:\nMs. Margaret Muigai Edwin,\nDirector, Communication & Public Information Directorate: Africa CDC |\nTel: +255 742 635 592 | Email:\nedwinm@africacdc.org\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is the continental autonomous Health agency of the African Union that strengthens the capacity and capability of Africa’s public health institutions as well as partnerships to detect and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats and outbreaks, based on data-driven interventions and programmes.

Africa\\nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia – 24 April 2024\\n– The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) kicked-off two groundbreaking projects: the Integrated Genomic Surveillance and Data Sharing Platform (IGS) and Integrated Genomic Surveillance for Outbreak Detection (DETECT). These initiatives, co-funded by the European Union, are poised to fortify the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative (Africa PGI 2.0), enhancing the capacity of member states for molecular detection of outbreaks, AMR genomic surveillance, and timely data sharing across Africa.\\nThe kick-off meeting, convened at the Africa CDC Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, signified a pivotal moment in the collaboration between the African CDC and the European Commission Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen outbreak detection and disease surveillance throughout Africa.\\nThrough these projects implemented by the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HaDEA), Africa CDC, and HERA, in partnership with African Union (AU) Member States, the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) and the Africa Public Health Foundation (APHF), will strengthen national and regional capacities to promptly detect outbreaks, support the integration of AMR genomic surveillance, and facilitate swift and high-quality data sharing for public health decision-making.\\nHis Excellency Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC, emphasized the significance of this partnership stating, “The increasing number of outbreaks is driven by complex ecological, climatic, political, economic, and social factors, all of which are becoming more exacerbated on our continent. These projects are poised to strengthen laboratory detection and surveillance of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic diseases, as well as antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Africa. They also highlight the strategic partnership between Africa CDC and the European Commission.”\\nLaurent Muschel, Acting Director General of HERA, emphasized, “In the face of ongoing global health challenges, Africa CDC and HERA are taking together concrete actions to strengthen detection of outbreaks, AMR genomic surveillance, and timely data sharing across Africa. Fortifying multi-pathogen molecular detection and sequencing capabilities in the African Union is essential for global health security.”\\nAfrica CDC’s shift towards Africa PGI 2.0 signifies a transition from emergency response to building an optimized, resilient, and integrated molecular diagnostic and genomic surveillance ecosystem. It is critical and timely to incorporate lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, and empower national and regional reference laboratories to expand their capabilities to detect and characterize epidemic and pandemic-prone diseases. As demonstrated in previous outbreaks, molecular detection and genomic sequencing improves early detection and response to public health emergencies. Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, CEO of ASLM, remarked, “The launch of the two projects is pivotal in devising scalable and sustainable approaches for integrating molecular diagnostics and sequencing within Africa’s routine surveillance structures. We are eager to collaborate with the Africa CDC and HERA to strengthen laboratory systems ensuring effective responses to current and future health threats”.\\n“APHF will continue to strengthen collaboration with the Africa CDC and HERA to support the flagship Pathogen Genomics Initiative (Africa PGI) and advance public health laboratory systems for pandemic preparedness and response.” Said Dr. Ebere Okereke, CEO of APHF\\nThe Africa CDC is working with ASLM, APHF, Member States, the Africa Laboratory Technical Working Group, and other partners to ensure the effective and successful implementation of the two projects.\\n# #\\nFor more information:\\nDr. Sofonias Tessema, Program Lead, Africa PGI |Africa CDC| sofoniast@africacdc.org\\nMedia inquiries:\\nMs. Margaret Muigai Edwin,\\nDirector, Communication & Public Information Directorate: Africa CDC |\\nTel: +255 742 635 592 | Email:\\nedwinm@africacdc.org\\nAbout Africa CDC\\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is the continental autonomous Health agency of the African Union that strengthens the capacity and capability of Africa’s public health institutions as well as partnerships to detect and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats and outbreaks, based on data-driven interventions and programmes.

Prevention (\nAfrica CDC\n), The World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (\nWHO AFRO\n), and the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (\nWHO EMRO\n) extend their profound appreciation to the United Kingdom government for the recent\nannouncement\nof its transformative commitment to enhancing global health made during the 78\nth\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). The United Kingdom’s dedication to addressing the world’s most pressing health challenges through research, development, and collaboration is both commendable and inspiring.\nThe allocation of the United Kingdom’s investment of £95 million in tackling deadly diseases in Africa Programme II, will foster partnerships with countries and Africa-based organizations — Africa CDC and WHO — to detect and address future epidemics, combat drug-resistant infections, and address climate-related health challenges. Such collaborative efforts are essential in building stronger health systems and ensuring a more secure future for all.\nWe also commend the allocation of up to £103.5 million for the development of affordable vaccines and health products, along with initiatives to combat the spread of infectious diseases, particularly during pandemics, as a demonstration of the United Kingdom’s leadership in the field of global health. This investment will undoubtedly contribute to safeguarding the health and well-being of populations worldwide, preventing future outbreaks, and ultimately saving lives.\nThe commitment to protecting women’s sexual and reproductive health is a crucial step towards achieving a more equitable and inclusive world. By reducing preventable deaths and improving access to care, the United Kingdom is actively working to realize the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063 in promoting the well-being of all, regardless of geographic location.\nThe United Kingdom’s support for research and development in low- and middle-income countries, including advancements in drug administration methods, showcases a commitment to reaching even the most remote areas with life-saving care. This approach aligns with the principles of inclusivity and resilience that are fundamental to the global health agenda.\nThe commitment to health security by the United Kingdom through international development is evident in its track record of investing in research, development, and healthcare infrastructure. The impact of these efforts, from malaria treatments to diagnostics for drug-resistant tuberculosis, has been significant and has undoubtedly saved countless lives.\nWe would like to express our deep appreciation for the United Kingdom’s resolute dedication to advancing global health. Their commitment to research, innovation, and international cooperation increases optimism for a healthier and more prosperous world.\nWe look forward to continued collaboration and progress in achieving our shared global health objectives.\nH.E.

profound appreciation to the United Kingdom government for the recent\\nannouncement\\nof its transformative commitment to enhancing global health made during the 78\\nth\\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). The United Kingdom’s dedication to addressing the world’s most pressing health challenges through research, development, and collaboration is both commendable and inspiring.\\nThe allocation of the United Kingdom’s investment of £95 million in tackling deadly diseases in Africa Programme II, will foster partnerships with countries and Africa-based organizations — Africa CDC and WHO — to detect and address future epidemics, combat drug-resistant infections, and address climate-related health challenges. Such collaborative efforts are essential in building stronger health systems and ensuring a more secure future for all.\\nWe also commend the allocation of up to £103.5 million for the development of affordable vaccines and health products, along with initiatives to combat the spread of infectious diseases, particularly during pandemics, as a demonstration of the United Kingdom’s leadership in the field of global health. This investment will undoubtedly contribute to safeguarding the health and well-being of populations worldwide, preventing future outbreaks, and ultimately saving lives.\\nThe commitment to protecting women’s sexual and reproductive health is a crucial step towards achieving a more equitable and inclusive world. By reducing preventable deaths and improving access to care, the United Kingdom is actively working to realize the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063 in promoting the well-being of all, regardless of geographic location.\\nThe United Kingdom’s support for research and development in low- and middle-income countries, including advancements in drug administration methods, showcases a commitment to reaching even the most remote areas with life-saving care. This approach aligns with the principles of inclusivity and resilience that are fundamental to the global health agenda.\\nThe commitment to health security by the United Kingdom through international development is evident in its track record of investing in research, development, and healthcare infrastructure. The impact of these efforts, from malaria treatments to diagnostics for drug-resistant tuberculosis, has been significant and has undoubtedly saved countless lives.\\nWe would like to express our deep appreciation for the United Kingdom’s resolute dedication to advancing global health. Their commitment to research, innovation, and international cooperation increases optimism for a healthier and more prosperous world.\\nWe look forward to continued collaboration and progress in achieving our shared global health objectives.\\nH.E.

content\nWHO Africa\nAfrican health leaders begin work on roadmap to reshape global health financing on the continent\nAfrican health leaders begin work on roadmap to reshape global health financing on the continent\n13 June 2024\nAddis Ababa –\nMore than 80  ministry of health experts, regional and global partners and civil society representatives have set in motion the development of a roadmap to catalyse action to reshape the health financing ecosystem in Africa, and make it fit-for-purpose towards 2030 and beyond.\nThe meeting was convened by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Regional Office for Africa, in partnership with the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the African Constituency Bureau of the Global Fund.\nThe development of the roadmap marks an important step in the ongoing process of identifying ways to ensure that global health initiatives (GHIs) and other external funding partners are more effective, efficient and equitable in complementing domestic financing, to strengthen health system capacities, accelerate progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), and deliver health impact.\nOver the past two decades, GHIs such as Gavi, the Global Fund and the Global Financing Facility have contributed to enormous progress in protecting health and improving lives of people in Africa and across the world. However, important changes in health needs, financing and governance necessitate a renewed vision for how they support countries to deliver sustainable impact.\n“With the growing need for strong and resilient health systems that can adapt to emerging threats, while continuing to meet existing health needs, the imperative of optimizing the impact of available resources is becoming increasingly urgent to advance Africa towards universal health coverage,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s Regional Director for Africa.\nFocusing on GHIs as an entry point and catalyst for change in the broader health financing ecosystem, the\nLusaka Agenda\n, published on UHC Day on 12 December 2023, represented the culmination of a 14-month, multi-stakeholder process that captured consensus around five strategic shifts for the long-term evolution of GHIs. The roadmap for the implementation of the Lusaka Agenda implementation in Africa will set out priority actions to realize these shifts.\n“At the 37th African Union (summit in February, African leaders endorsed the establishment of an accountability mechanism within the AU architecture to ensure effective implementation of the Lusaka Agenda on the continent. Our discussions over the past two days began to give shape to what this might look like,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC.\nThe draft roadmap will be refined over the coming months, before it is presented for consideration by  ministers of health at the WHO Regional Committee for Africa, to be held in Brazzaville, Congo, in August this year.\n“The Lusaka Agenda will ensure long-term sustainability and will propel countries towards achieving UHC,” said Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, and co-chair of the Lusaka Agenda Working Group.\nTo deliver more sustainable impact in the face of emerging threats such as climate change and conflicts, the key shifts highlighted in the Lusaka Agenda include a  focus on strengthening primary health care by bolstering health systems, catalysing action on domestic financing,  improving joint approaches to achieving health equity, and strategic and operational coherence among  GHIs. The Lusaka Agenda  also calls for  improved  coordination of approaches to products, reseach and development (R&D) and regional manufacturing, to address market and policy failures in global health.\n“The Lusaka Agenda is now moving from talk to action, led by countries, and GHIs are listening,” added Linda Mafu, the Global Fund’s head of Civil Society and Political Advocacy.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\n######################\nOutput:",

content\\nWHO Africa\\nAfrican health leaders begin work on roadmap to reshape global health financing on the continent\\nAfrican health leaders begin work on roadmap to reshape global health financing on the continent\\n13 June 2024\\nAddis Ababa –\\nMore than 80  ministry of health experts, regional and global partners and civil society representatives have set in motion the development of a roadmap to catalyse action to reshape the health financing ecosystem in Africa, and make it fit-for-purpose towards 2030 and beyond.\\nThe meeting was convened by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Regional Office for Africa, in partnership with the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the African Constituency Bureau of the Global Fund.\\nThe development of the roadmap marks an important step in the ongoing process of identifying ways to ensure that global health initiatives (GHIs) and other external funding partners are more effective, efficient and equitable in complementing domestic financing, to strengthen health system capacities, accelerate progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), and deliver health impact.\\nOver the past two decades, GHIs such as Gavi, the Global Fund and the Global Financing Facility have contributed to enormous progress in protecting health and improving lives of people in Africa and across the world. However, important changes in health needs, financing and governance necessitate a renewed vision for how they support countries to deliver sustainable impact.\\n“With the growing need for strong and resilient health systems that can adapt to emerging threats, while continuing to meet existing health needs, the imperative of optimizing the impact of available resources is becoming increasingly urgent to advance Africa towards universal health coverage,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s Regional Director for Africa.\\nFocusing on GHIs as an entry point and catalyst for change in the broader health financing ecosystem, the\\nLusaka Agenda\\n, published on UHC Day on 12 December 2023, represented the culmination of a 14-month, multi-stakeholder process that captured consensus around five strategic shifts for the long-term evolution of GHIs. The roadmap for the implementation of the Lusaka Agenda implementation in Africa will set out priority actions to realize these shifts.\\n“At the 37th African Union (summit in February, African leaders endorsed the establishment of an accountability mechanism within the AU architecture to ensure effective implementation of the Lusaka Agenda on the continent. Our discussions over the past two days began to give shape to what this might look like,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC.\\nThe draft roadmap will be refined over the coming months, before it is presented for consideration by  ministers of health at the WHO Regional Committee for Africa, to be held in Brazzaville, Congo, in August this year.\\n“The Lusaka Agenda will ensure long-term sustainability and will propel countries towards achieving UHC,” said Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, and co-chair of the Lusaka Agenda Working Group.\\nTo deliver more sustainable impact in the face of emerging threats such as climate change and conflicts, the key shifts highlighted in the Lusaka Agenda include a  focus on strengthening primary health care by bolstering health systems, catalysing action on domestic financing,  improving joint approaches to achieving health equity, and strategic and operational coherence among  GHIs. The Lusaka Agenda  also calls for  improved  coordination of approaches to products, reseach and development (R&D) and regional manufacturing, to address market and policy failures in global health.\\n“The Lusaka Agenda is now moving from talk to action, led by countries, and GHIs are listening,” added Linda Mafu, the Global Fund’s head of Civil Society and Political Advocacy.\\nClick image to enlarge\\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\\nCommunications and marketing officer\\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\\nEmail:\\nboakyeagyemangc\\n[at]\\nwho.int\\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"World Health Organization\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health.

commitment and support to buy vaccines manufactured in Africa to build a sustainable industry capable of producing vaccines at scale.\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) hosted a High-Level meeting themed ”Ministerial Consultations on Local Manufacturing” on the sidelines of the 77\nth\nWorld Health Assembly.\nDuring the ministerial meeting, over 40 ministers of health, representatives from regional economic communities and partners were briefed on the\nfindings\nof the vaccine supplier’s landscape analysis Africa CDC produced in partnership with Clinton Health Access Initiative and PATH, formerly the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health.\nThe ministers offered insights on the continent’s readiness and the challenges that manufacturers currently face, such as getting Africans to buy vaccines manufactured on the continent, which is central to making the business case.\nCurrently, nine commercial-scale production facilities on the continent are prepared for technology transfers, and three manufacturers are set to produce eight vaccines for the African market by 2030. These eight products require purchasers to remain commercially viable beyond their country’s domestic demand.\n“Across the spectrum of requirements for the near-to-market products, predictable demand is the central challenge faced by manufacturers,” the meeting heard.\nAfrica is confronted with limited demand for homegrown vaccine offers, fragmented markets, and poor economies of scale that limit the business case for local manufacturers to invest in vaccine manufacturing facilities and other health product technologies.\nThe ministers suggested fast-track regulatory harmonization to push the wide distribution of medicines and to assure quality. There is a need to strengthen national regulatory authorities and domesticate the\nAU model law at the national level\n.\nThe AU Summit in 2024 decided the establishment of the African Pooled Procurement Mechanism (APPM) as a solution. APPM aims to improve access to quality and affordable health products and promote the localization of manufacturing led by the Africa CDC.\nDuring the briefing, the AU Member states pledged to support the continental ambition, avoid competition amongst member states, and strengthen the regional mechanism to ensure the continent can manufacture the vaccines and other health products it needs. It was reiterated that the African Medicines Agency (AMA) requires member states’ collective support to obtain affordable quality medicines.\nThe meeting allowed partners to share their responses in support of the local manufacturing agenda on the continent. The Africa CDC will pursue critical interventions in vaccine manufacturing to be on course to achieve the ambition of manufacturing 60% of vaccines needed by 2040.

APPM aims to improve access to quality and affordable health products and promote the localization of manufacturing led by the Africa CDC.\\nDuring the briefing, the AU Member states pledged to support the continental ambition, avoid competition amongst member states, and strengthen the regional mechanism to ensure the continent can manufacture the vaccines and other health products it needs. It was reiterated that the African Medicines Agency (AMA) requires member states’ collective support to obtain affordable quality medicines.\\nThe meeting allowed partners to share their responses in support of the local manufacturing agenda on the continent. The Africa CDC will pursue critical interventions in vaccine manufacturing to be on course to achieve the ambition of manufacturing 60% of vaccines needed by 2040.

region’s first-ever health workforce investment charter launched\nAfrican region’s first-ever health workforce investment charter launched\n06 May 2024\nWindhoek –\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa and partner organizations today launched the region’s first-ever health investment charter that aims to align and drive sustainable investment in the health workforce.\nWith a bold target of halving the African region’s critical 6.1-million health workforce shortage by 2030, the African Health Workforce Investment Charter will mobilize and align domestic and partner funding to strengthen, grow and retain the continent’s health workforce, especially in rural and primary health care settings.\n“Any discussion about the delivery of health care services must acknowledge that, for these services to be rendered and rendered effectively, we need feet on the ground,” said Honourable Dr Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila, Namibia’s Prime Minister. “For the health professionals to do their work effectively, they must be well resourced and capacitated in the best ways possible.”\nIn addition to shortages, the African region faces many other health workforce challenges, including, rising unemployment, excessive out-migration and low quality of training. Low health investment and limited prioritization of the health workforce have critically exposed health systems. Investment in health, especially from domestic sources, is still low and inadequate for many countries to meet the universal health coverage and ensure health security\n“The numbers of Africans who have left the continent in search of greener pastures in other parts of the world are staggering. It is a matter that needs to be addressed as a top priority for African governments and indeed all those who wish to see a shift in the historical as well as current trends,” said Honourable Dr Kalumbi Shangula, Minister of Health and Social Services of Namibia.\nThe charter launched today brought together the health workforce investment efforts of all stakeholders, including national governments, the private health sector, civil society, external financing institutions and development partners in Africa.\n“By investing in the health workforce, we not only address the challenges within the sector but also generate dividends in education, employment and gender equality,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “These investments will contribute to our sustained efforts in attracting more resources and improving the quality of our health workforce.”\nInvesting in the health workforce will have positive spin-offs in the form of decent jobs, particularly for women and youth who often face barriers to employment. By providing opportunities for education, training and career progression, the Charter will immensely contribute to the economic empowerment of these demographics and fundamentally support inclusive economic growth.\nAdditionally, health labour force investment also brings multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage.\nFor every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, and that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%.\n“Studies show that investments in the health sector yield substantial economic returns, estimating a nine-to-one return on investment. The new narrative that we are promoting is to transform the health sector to move from liability to an asset for the economy of our countries,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter was inaugurated in Namibia during the Health Workforce Investment Forum being held from 6 to 8 May 2024. Efforts will continue to be made to engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\n######################\nOutput:",

align domestic and partner funding to strengthen, grow and retain the continent’s health workforce, especially in rural and primary health care settings.\\n“Any discussion about the delivery of health care services must acknowledge that, for these services to be rendered and rendered effectively, we need feet on the ground,” said Honourable Dr Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila, Namibia’s Prime Minister. “For the health professionals to do their work effectively, they must be well resourced and capacitated in the best ways possible.”\\nIn addition to shortages, the African region faces many other health workforce challenges, including, rising unemployment, excessive out-migration and low quality of training. Low health investment and limited prioritization of the health workforce have critically exposed health systems. Investment in health, especially from domestic sources, is still low and inadequate for many countries to meet the universal health coverage and ensure health security\\n“The numbers of Africans who have left the continent in search of greener pastures in other parts of the world are staggering. It is a matter that needs to be addressed as a top priority for African governments and indeed all those who wish to see a shift in the historical as well as current trends,” said Honourable Dr Kalumbi Shangula, Minister of Health and Social Services of Namibia.\\nThe charter launched today brought together the health workforce investment efforts of all stakeholders, including national governments, the private health sector, civil society, external financing institutions and development partners in Africa.\\n“By investing in the health workforce, we not only address the challenges within the sector but also generate dividends in education, employment and gender equality,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “These investments will contribute to our sustained efforts in attracting more resources and improving the quality of our health workforce.”\\nInvesting in the health workforce will have positive spin-offs in the form of decent jobs, particularly for women and youth who often face barriers to employment. By providing opportunities for education, training and career progression, the Charter will immensely contribute to the economic empowerment of these demographics and fundamentally support inclusive economic growth.\\nAdditionally, health labour force investment also brings multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage.\\nFor every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, and that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%.\\n“Studies show that investments in the health sector yield substantial economic returns, estimating a nine-to-one return on investment. The new narrative that we are promoting is to transform the health sector to move from liability to an asset for the economy of our countries,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nThe Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter was inaugurated in Namibia during the Health Workforce Investment Forum being held from 6 to 8 May 2024. Efforts will continue to be made to engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.\\nClick image to enlarge\\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\\nCommunications and marketing officer\\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\\nEmail:\\nboakyeagyemangc\\n[at]\\nwho.int\\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The WHO Regional Office for Africa is a regional branch of the World Health Organization that works with partner organizations to promote health initiatives across Africa, including launching the African region's first-ever health workforce investment charter aimed at addressing critical workforce shortages.\\\"<|>\\\"The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa and partner organizations today launched the region’s first-ever health investment charter...\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"African Health Workforce Investment Charter\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The African Health Workforce Investment Charter is a significant regional initiative launched in May 2024 intended to align and drive sustainable investments toward halving the health workforce shortage by 2030, involving stakeholders such as governments, private sector, civil society, and development partners.\\\"<|>\\\"African region’s first-ever health workforce investment charter launched...aims to align and drive sustainable investment in the health workforce...inaugurated in Namibia during the Health Workforce Investment Forum being held from 6 to 8 May 2024\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Health Workforce Investment Forum\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"A forum held from 6 to 8 May 2024 in Namibia, during which the Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter was inaugurated, with the goal to engage multisectoral stakeholders and mobilize commitments and investments toward improving the health workforce.\\\"<|>\\\"The Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter was inaugurated in Namibia during the Health Workforce Investment Forum being held from 6 to 8 May 2024\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Namibia\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Namibia is a country in the African region that hosted the inauguration of the African Health Workforce Investment Charter and the Health Workforce Investment Forum, with active participation by its government officials.\\\"<|>\\\"Windhoek –... charter launched today... inaugurated in Namibia during the Health Workforce Investment Forum...\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Dr Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"The Prime Minister of Namibia who emphasized the importance of having a properly resourced and capacitated health workforce to effectively deliver healthcare services.\\\"<|>\\\"said Honourable Dr Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila, Namibia’s Prime Minister.

group to mitigate against recurring epidemics in Africa and prevent future pandemics. The planned Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) was announced during the Mpox in Africa—High-Level Emergency Regional Meeting, held in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 11 to 13 April. “We propose the establishment of an African-led multi-disciplinary, multicountry Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa with the overarching goal of establishing a research network to advance the elimination of mpox,” Jean B. Nachega (Professor Extraordinary of Medicine Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases Stellenbosch University Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences) told the meeting.\nMpox is endemic to 12 countries in Africa\nNachega said Africa has faced a long-standing unmet need for sustainable local diagnostic laboratories and research capacity for mpox.\n“MpoxReC will address these needs and provide outcome monitoring and surveillance across endemic African countries while simultaneously contributing to much-needed South-South, multi-disciplinary, and inter-professional research collaborations and capacity-building,” he said. He said the continent needs to share national and regional epidemic preparedness frameworks on the disease.\nThe research group, which includes global partners and African collaborators, will initially focus on Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, and the Republic of Congo.  Professor Nadia Sam-Agudu will lead researchers at the University of Cape Coast Ghana, Professor Samuel Nakoune Yandoko will head the team at Pasteur Institute in Bangui, the Central African Republic, co-principal investigators Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe and Professor Placide Mbala will represent the DRC’s Institute National Research Biomedical, Professor Dimie Ogoina from Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital will represent Nigeria, Cameroon’s Pasteur Institute research team will be led by Professor Richard Njouom and Congo will be led by Professor Francine Ntoumi from the Congolese Foundation for Medical Research. Expansion to other African countries will take place later.\n28 April 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nDiseases\nMpox\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

research group to mitigate against recurring epidemics in Africa and prevent future pandemics. The planned Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) was announced during the Mpox in Africa—High-Level Emergency Regional Meeting, held in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 11 to 13 April. “We propose the establishment of an African-led multi-disciplinary, multicountry Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa with the overarching goal of establishing a research network to advance the elimination of mpox,” Jean B. Nachega (Professor Extraordinary of Medicine Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases Stellenbosch University Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences) told the meeting.\\nMpox is endemic to 12 countries in Africa\\nNachega said Africa has faced a long-standing unmet need for sustainable local diagnostic laboratories and research capacity for mpox.\\n“MpoxReC will address these needs and provide outcome monitoring and surveillance across endemic African countries while simultaneously contributing to much-needed South-South, multi-disciplinary, and inter-professional research collaborations and capacity-building,” he said. He said the continent needs to share national and regional epidemic preparedness frameworks on the disease.\\nThe research group, which includes global partners and African collaborators, will initially focus on Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, and the Republic of Congo.  Professor Nadia Sam-Agudu will lead researchers at the University of Cape Coast Ghana, Professor Samuel Nakoune Yandoko will head the team at Pasteur Institute in Bangui, the Central African Republic, co-principal investigators Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe and Professor Placide Mbala will represent the DRC’s Institute National Research Biomedical, Professor Dimie Ogoina from Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital will represent Nigeria, Cameroon’s Pasteur Institute research team will be led by Professor Richard Njouom and Congo will be led by Professor Francine Ntoumi from the Congolese Foundation for Medical Research. Expansion to other African countries will take place later.\\n28 April 2024\\nTheme\\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\\nRegion\\nCentral Africa\\n,\\nEastern Africa\\n,\\nNorthern Africa\\n,\\nSouthern Africa\\n,\\nWestern Africa\\nDiseases\\nMpox\\nRelated Content\\nMedia Advisory\\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\\nPress Releases\\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\\nPress Releases\\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\\nFollow Us\\nTwitter\\nLinkedin\\nFacebook-f\\nYoutube\\nFlickr\\nInstagram\\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nPress Releases\nAntimicrobial Resistance is a Greater Threat than HIV-AIDS, TB and Malaria, Says New Report\nADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, August 15\n– The likelihood of falling ill or dying from diseases that resist treatment has escalated in Africa, with children and other vulnerable groups being most at risk, according to a new report by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).\n“The continent faces the highest mortality rate from antimicrobial resistance (AMR), with 27.3 deaths per 100,000—exceeding the combined death toll from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria,” said the ‘African Union Landmark Report’ launched today at Africa CDC headquarters.\nAfrica bears a significant burden of infectious diseases, accounting for approximately 95% of malaria deaths, 70% of people living with HIV, and 25% of TB deaths globally, said the report.\n“We must not ignore this silent threat that disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable among us,” said Africa CDC Deputy Director General, Dr Raji Tajudeen.\nAMR occurs when microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites develop resistance to antimicrobial drugs, a process hastened by human behaviors such as the misuse and overuse of these drugs in healthcare, agriculture and food systems. This renders antibiotics and other antimicrobials less effective, causing treatment failures, increased disease spread, severe illness, disability and higher mortality rates.\nDespite the estimated USD2-6 billion needed annually for an effective AMR response across Africa, current funding is only a tenth of that allocated to other major diseases. This underfunding makes AMR a significant barrier to sustainable development, hindering progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.\nAn estimated 700,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections globally. Without timely intervention, this number is projected to reach 10 million by 2050, with Africa accounting for 4.5 million.\n“Fighting disease requires resources and working with member states and our partners we need to do all we can to save lives,” said Dr Tajudeen, speaking at the launch of a report on AMR in Africa. The event also initiated discussions on a roadmap and targets to advance Africa’s battle against AMR. The outcomes are expected to inform the upcoming United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting in September—a crucial platform for global action on this escalating crisis.\nDr Huyam Salih, the director of the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), emphasized the critical role that the AU must play in combating AMR. “Antimicrobial resistance is not just a health issue—it is a threat to our agrifood systems, food safety, food security, livelihoods, and economies,” she said.\nBy 2050, global healthcare costs could exceed USD1 trillion per year, and livestock production could decline by 2.6% to 7.5% annually due to AMR, according to Dr Salih. “In Africa, the situation is particularly alarming, with 37 countries reporting the prevalence of AMR in animal farms, yet only 16% of African countries are conducting routine AMR surveillance in animals as of 2023,” she said.\nDr Salih also called for urgent action to strengthen leadership, expand surveillance and data systems, promote the responsible use of antimicrobials, improve public and animal health systems, and secure sustainable financing to combat AMR effectively. “Our health, our food, and our future depend on the actions we take now,” she stressed.\nDr Tajudeen said addressing AMR in Africa requires engaging all levels of society in a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. “Unless we work together, overcoming antimicrobial resistance will be a difficult and long-drawn process that will cost lives,” he said.\nCurrently, millions in Africa lack access to essential antibiotics, with a study by Africa CDC and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine revealing that only 1.3% of microbiology labs in 14 member states can test for key AMR pathogens.\nThe head of the African Society for Laboratory Medicine, Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, reaffirmed the organization’s commitment to strengthening African laboratory capacities to combat antimicrobial resistance. “Our goal is to ensure the continued efficacy of treatments and promote data-driven solutions to safeguard public health across the continent,” he said.\nDr Tajudeen underscored the importance of prioritizing infection prevention, strengthening health and food systems, developing human resources, ensuring sustainable access to diagnostics and therapeutics, and investing in laboratory infrastructure for effective surveillance and data generation.\nThe report recommends an increase in the availability of high-quality diagnostics, vaccines, and antimicrobials for high-priority pathogens in high-risk African countries.\nFor more information\n:\nMedia inquiries:\nMargaret Edwin,\nDirector of Communication & Public Information Division: Africa CDC | Tel: +251 986 632 878 | Email:\nEdwinM@africacdc.org\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

content\\nEmail:\\ncommunications@africacdc.org\\nSearch\\nSearch\\nNews\\n/\\nPress Releases\\nAntimicrobial Resistance is a Greater Threat than HIV-AIDS, TB and Malaria, Says New Report\\nADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, August 15\\n– The likelihood of falling ill or dying from diseases that resist treatment has escalated in Africa, with children and other vulnerable groups being most at risk, according to a new report by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).\\n“The continent faces the highest mortality rate from antimicrobial resistance (AMR), with 27.3 deaths per 100,000—exceeding the combined death toll from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria,” said the ‘African Union Landmark Report’ launched today at Africa CDC headquarters.\\nAfrica bears a significant burden of infectious diseases, accounting for approximately 95% of malaria deaths, 70% of people living with HIV, and 25% of TB deaths globally, said the report.\\n“We must not ignore this silent threat that disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable among us,” said Africa CDC Deputy Director General, Dr Raji Tajudeen.\\nAMR occurs when microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites develop resistance to antimicrobial drugs, a process hastened by human behaviors such as the misuse and overuse of these drugs in healthcare, agriculture and food systems. This renders antibiotics and other antimicrobials less effective, causing treatment failures, increased disease spread, severe illness, disability and higher mortality rates.\\nDespite the estimated USD2-6 billion needed annually for an effective AMR response across Africa, current funding is only a tenth of that allocated to other major diseases. This underfunding makes AMR a significant barrier to sustainable development, hindering progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.\\nAn estimated 700,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections globally. Without timely intervention, this number is projected to reach 10 million by 2050, with Africa accounting for 4.5 million.\\n“Fighting disease requires resources and working with member states and our partners we need to do all we can to save lives,” said Dr Tajudeen, speaking at the launch of a report on AMR in Africa. The event also initiated discussions on a roadmap and targets to advance Africa’s battle against AMR. The outcomes are expected to inform the upcoming United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting in September—a crucial platform for global action on this escalating crisis.\\nDr Huyam Salih, the director of the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), emphasized the critical role that the AU must play in combating AMR. “Antimicrobial resistance is not just a health issue—it is a threat to our agrifood systems, food safety, food security, livelihoods, and economies,” she said.\\nBy 2050, global healthcare costs could exceed USD1 trillion per year, and livestock production could decline by 2.6% to 7.5% annually due to AMR, according to Dr Salih. “In Africa, the situation is particularly alarming, with 37 countries reporting the prevalence of AMR in animal farms, yet only 16% of African countries are conducting routine AMR surveillance in animals as of 2023,” she said.\\nDr Salih also called for urgent action to strengthen leadership, expand surveillance and data systems, promote the responsible use of antimicrobials, improve public and animal health systems, and secure sustainable financing to combat AMR effectively. “Our health, our food, and our future depend on the actions we take now,” she stressed.\\nDr Tajudeen said addressing AMR in Africa requires engaging all levels of society in a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. “Unless we work together, overcoming antimicrobial resistance will be a difficult and long-drawn process that will cost lives,” he said.\\nCurrently, millions in Africa lack access to essential antibiotics, with a study by Africa CDC and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine revealing that only 1.3% of microbiology labs in 14 member states can test for key AMR pathogens.\\nThe head of the African Society for Laboratory Medicine, Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, reaffirmed the organization’s commitment to strengthening African laboratory capacities to combat antimicrobial resistance. “Our goal is to ensure the continued efficacy of treatments and promote data-driven solutions to safeguard public health across the continent,” he said.\\nDr Tajudeen underscored the importance of prioritizing infection prevention, strengthening health and food systems, developing human resources, ensuring sustainable access to diagnostics and therapeutics, and investing in laboratory infrastructure for effective surveillance and data generation.\\nThe report recommends an increase in the availability of high-quality diagnostics, vaccines, and antimicrobials for high-priority pathogens in high-risk African countries.\\nFor more information\\n:\\nMedia inquiries:\\nMargaret Edwin,\\nDirector of Communication & Public Information Division: Africa CDC | Tel: +251 986 632 878 | Email:\\nEdwinM@africacdc.org\\nAbout Africa CDC\\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

Releases\nEnhancing Vaccine Storage Efficiencies in Africa\n8 February 2024,\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), in collaboration with the Mastercard Foundation under the Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative, has provided state-of-the-art cold chain equipment to five (5) African Union Member States.  These Member States are Botswana, Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zambia, are part of the initial delivery targeting a total of 32 Member States in the phase one investment for the procurement of Cold Chain Equipment (CCE). The equipment was procured and delivered through the support of UNICEF, one of the initiative’s implementing partners. The support aligns with the Africa CDC goal of strengthening healthcare systems and enhancing the response to vaccine-preventable diseases.\nThe cumulative equipment across the five (5) Member States, which consists of 465 refrigerators and freezers, 1,150 temperature monitors, 5,253 vaccine carriers and cold boxes, and 2 cold rooms, all valued up to USD 3.3 million, will significantly enhance the healthcare infrastructure and capabilities. The equipment is designed to efficiently manage vaccines and vital medical supplies, supporting the expansion of COVID-19 vaccination and other programs, including routine Immunization, which aims to ensure safe and effective vaccines reach every child. By expanding the cold chain storage capacity, the Ministries of Health will be able to offer a more comprehensive vaccination program and improve vaccine coverage rates.\nH.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, the Africa CDC Director General, emphasizes the significant benefits of this equipment in minimizing vaccine wastage due to temperature fluctuations. “This optimization allows the Ministries of Health to allocate healthcare budgets more effectively and allocate resources to other critical areas of healthcare. The availability of CCE facilitates extensive immunization activities, reaching remote and underserved communities. This, in turn, leads to improved vaccine coverage rates, reducing the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases, including COVID-19, and strengthening health security in Africa towards attaining global health security,” Dr Kaseya said.\nThe provision of Cold Chain Equipment is crucial in preserving vaccines and maintaining the efficacy of temperature-sensitive medical supplies. The addition of freezers and refrigerators enables member states to store a wider range of vaccines, including those requiring ultra-low temperatures like COVID-19. This expansion of cold chain storage is essential to pandemic preparedness and will enable member states to offer more comprehensive vaccination programs.\nThe cold boxes and vaccine carriers provide reliable transportation while maintaining the recommended vaccine temperature, ensuring vaccine efficacy and safety. This feature increases geographic coverage and contributes to improved immunization service delivery and health security in Africa by enhancing the capacity of Ministries of Health to manage vaccines and strengthen their cold chain systems.\nDuring the handover ceremony in Zambia, the Honorable Sylvia Masebo, the Minister of Health of the Republic of Zambia, highlighted that the support from Afric a CDC aligns with Zambia’s goals to have readily available life-saving vaccines and strengthened cold chain capacity, and the Ministry will seek more equipment to build on the gains made, while implementing the integration of COVID-19 vaccines into primary healthcare services.\nThe Africa CDC, Mastercard Foundation, and UNICEF anticipate the successful installation and efficient use of these CCEs in healthcare facilities, positively catalyzing and strengthening the healthcare landscape in the Member States. With this support, the Ministries of Health are better positioned to respond effectively to public health emergencies, ensuring equitable access to vaccines and treatments. The support provided by the Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation demonstrates their commitment to strengthening healthcare systems in Africa. It underscores the importance of collective collaboration in addressing global health challenges and ensuring vaccine equity for Africa.\nFor more information:\nDr Merawi Aragaw| Head of Division for Surveillance and Disease Intelligence | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: merawia@africa-union.org| M: +251912611294 Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nFor media inquiry:\nFor media enquiries please contact:\nDorothy Njagi\n| Senior Communication Officer- Communication & Public Information directorate | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: email:\nnjagid@africacdc.org\n| Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous Public Health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

content\\nEmail:\\ncommunications@africacdc.org\\nSearch\\nSearch\\nNews\\n/\\nPress Releases\\nEnhancing Vaccine Storage Efficiencies in Africa\\n8 February 2024,\\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), in collaboration with the Mastercard Foundation under the Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative, has provided state-of-the-art cold chain equipment to five (5) African Union Member States.  These Member States are Botswana, Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zambia, are part of the initial delivery targeting a total of 32 Member States in the phase one investment for the procurement of Cold Chain Equipment (CCE). The equipment was procured and delivered through the support of UNICEF, one of the initiative’s implementing partners. The support aligns with the Africa CDC goal of strengthening healthcare systems and enhancing the response to vaccine-preventable diseases.\\nThe cumulative equipment across the five (5) Member States, which consists of 465 refrigerators and freezers, 1,150 temperature monitors, 5,253 vaccine carriers and cold boxes, and 2 cold rooms, all valued up to USD 3.3 million, will significantly enhance the healthcare infrastructure and capabilities. The equipment is designed to efficiently manage vaccines and vital medical supplies, supporting the expansion of COVID-19 vaccination and other programs, including routine Immunization, which aims to ensure safe and effective vaccines reach every child. By expanding the cold chain storage capacity, the Ministries of Health will be able to offer a more comprehensive vaccination program and improve vaccine coverage rates.\\nH.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, the Africa CDC Director General, emphasizes the significant benefits of this equipment in minimizing vaccine wastage due to temperature fluctuations. “This optimization allows the Ministries of Health to allocate healthcare budgets more effectively and allocate resources to other critical areas of healthcare. The availability of CCE facilitates extensive immunization activities, reaching remote and underserved communities. This, in turn, leads to improved vaccine coverage rates, reducing the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases, including COVID-19, and strengthening health security in Africa towards attaining global health security,” Dr Kaseya said.\\nThe provision of Cold Chain Equipment is crucial in preserving vaccines and maintaining the efficacy of temperature-sensitive medical supplies. The addition of freezers and refrigerators enables member states to store a wider range of vaccines, including those requiring ultra-low temperatures like COVID-19. This expansion of cold chain storage is essential to pandemic preparedness and will enable member states to offer more comprehensive vaccination programs.\\nThe cold boxes and vaccine carriers provide reliable transportation while maintaining the recommended vaccine temperature, ensuring vaccine efficacy and safety. This feature increases geographic coverage and contributes to improved immunization service delivery and health security in Africa by enhancing the capacity of Ministries of Health to manage vaccines and strengthen their cold chain systems.\\nDuring the handover ceremony in Zambia, the Honorable Sylvia Masebo, the Minister of Health of the Republic of Zambia, highlighted that the support from Afric a CDC aligns with Zambia’s goals to have readily available life-saving vaccines and strengthened cold chain capacity, and the Ministry will seek more equipment to build on the gains made, while implementing the integration of COVID-19 vaccines into primary healthcare services.\\nThe Africa CDC, Mastercard Foundation, and UNICEF anticipate the successful installation and efficient use of these CCEs in healthcare facilities, positively catalyzing and strengthening the healthcare landscape in the Member States. With this support, the Ministries of Health are better positioned to respond effectively to public health emergencies, ensuring equitable access to vaccines and treatments. The support provided by the Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation demonstrates their commitment to strengthening healthcare systems in Africa. It underscores the importance of collective collaboration in addressing global health challenges and ensuring vaccine equity for Africa.\\nFor more information:\\nDr Merawi Aragaw| Head of Division for Surveillance and Disease Intelligence | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: merawia@africa-union.org| M: +251912611294 Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\\nFacebook\\n|\\nTwitter\\nFor media inquiry:\\nFor media enquiries please contact:\\nDorothy Njagi\\n| Senior Communication Officer- Communication & Public Information directorate | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: email:\\nnjagid@africacdc.org\\n| Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\\nFacebook\\n|\\nTwitter\\nAbout Africa CDC\\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous Public Health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

Africa's Health Security\n17 July 2024\nEmergency Preparedness and Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG)\nBrazzaville -\nIn a major step towards strengthening health security in the African Region, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) has established an Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG). This independent body serves as the principal advisory group to WHO AFRO for strategic guidance on all matters pertaining to public health emergency preparedness and response.\nThe EPR Technical Advisory Group will play a critical role in supporting WHO African Member States to fortify health security in the face of diverse emergencies. Countries in the WHO African Region experience over 100 health emergencies annually which disrupt the economy and prosperity of communities and weaken already fragile health systems. With climate change and conflict aggravating more than half of Africa’s health emergencies, the next pandemic is not just a possibility, it's imminent. It is imperative, now more than ever, to enhance the Emergency Preparedness and Response capabilities within the Region.\nComposed of 16 distinguished experts (details below) from diverse fields like epidemiology, public health, global health, vaccinology, paediatrics, nutrition, internal medicine, infectious diseases, programme management, health-care administration, health economics, health communication, sociology, the EPR-TAG advises the WHO AFRO Regional Director on key issues. These include assessing the regional context of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies; conducting horizon scanning for new and emerging threats; providing strategic guidance on preparedness, response, and recovery strategies; reviewing progress in implementing regional health security initiatives; and strengthening country ownership and decision-making in emergency response.\nThe EPR-TAG is chaired by Dr Deo Nshimirimana, a retired WHO medical doctor renowned for his expertise in immunization in emergency settings. Assisting him is Dr Rebecca Martin, Vice President of Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute, appointed as the Vice-Chairperson. Dr Martin brings decades of experience in health security, emergency response and immunization. Both leaders bring a wealth of experience in public health and will guide the EPR-TAG for an initial three-year term. \"The opportunity to lead the EPR-TAG is a great honour, and I am thrilled to be part of this transformative team. I am confident that our collective expertise will significantly contribute to enhancing Africa's preparedness and response capabilities, ensuring a more resilient defence against ongoing and future health threats. Together, we can make a substantial impact on the well-being of African nations.\" - Dr Deo Nshimirimana.\nDr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, commented on the establishment of the EPR-TAG, stating: \"The Emergency Preparedness & Response technical group will play a critical role in strengthening our capacity, working collectively with partners, to support countries to prepare for, respond to, recover from public health emergencies while continuing to provide essential health care, across the African Region. I look forward, with our team, to leveraging its diverse expertise and independent perspective, for the benefit of our Member States.\"\nThe inaugural meeting of this prestigious group is taking place in Saly, Senegal from 16 to 17 July 2024. This gathering marks a historic moment as the EPR-TAG begins its journey to enhance health security across the African region. The establishment of the EPR-TAG underlines WHO AFRO's commitment to building a stronger, more resilient African Region prepared to face any public health challenge. With its expert guidance and collaborative approach, the EPR-TAG will play a vital role in protecting the health and well-being of millions of people across the continent.\nFor more information, please feel free to contact WHO via\neprtag\n[at]\nwho.int\n(eprtag[at]who[dot]int)\nList of the WHO AFRO Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG) Members\nName\nNationality\nDesignation\n1\nDeo NSHIMIRIMANA\n(EPR-TAG Chairperson)\nBurundi\nPublic Health Consultant\n2\nRebecca MARTIN\n(EPR-TAG Vice-Chairperson)\nUSA\nVice President, Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute\n3\nRick BRIGHT\nUSA\nCEO, Bright Global Health\n4\nDeoraj CAUSSY\nMauritius\nEpidemiologist, 360 Epidemiology Solutions\n5\nBernice DAHN\nLiberia\nVice President/Executive Dean, College of Health Sciences, University of Liberia\n6\nWafaa El-SADR\nEgypt\nFounder & Director, ICAP, Columbia University\n7\nNyasha GUZHA-CHANETSA\nZimbabwe\nChief State Veterinarian (Public Health & Trade Facilitation), South African Department of Agriculture, Rural Development & Environment\n8\nBanda KHALIFA\nGhana\nGlobal Health Expert and Managing Director, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Advancing Health Systems Innovations (CAdHSI)\n9\nRodrigue KOHOUN\nBenin\nPHC Technical Advisor to the Ministry of Health, Benin\n10\nAgnes MAHOMVA\nZimbabwe\nPublic Health Advisor to the President and Cabinet, Office of the President and Cabinet, Zimbabwe\n11\nBrice Wilfried BICABA\nBurkina Faso\nDirector General, Health & Public Hygiene, Ministry of Health, Burkina Faso\n12\nCheikh Tidiane MBOW\nSenegal\nChief, Health Promotion & Infectious Diseases Prevention Unit, MONUSCO (Goma\n######################\nOutput:",

Bolster Africa's Health Security\\n17 July 2024\\nEmergency Preparedness and Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG)\\nBrazzaville -\\nIn a major step towards strengthening health security in the African Region, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) has established an Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG). This independent body serves as the principal advisory group to WHO AFRO for strategic guidance on all matters pertaining to public health emergency preparedness and response.\\nThe EPR Technical Advisory Group will play a critical role in supporting WHO African Member States to fortify health security in the face of diverse emergencies. Countries in the WHO African Region experience over 100 health emergencies annually which disrupt the economy and prosperity of communities and weaken already fragile health systems. With climate change and conflict aggravating more than half of Africa’s health emergencies, the next pandemic is not just a possibility, it's imminent. It is imperative, now more than ever, to enhance the Emergency Preparedness and Response capabilities within the Region.\\nComposed of 16 distinguished experts (details below) from diverse fields like epidemiology, public health, global health, vaccinology, paediatrics, nutrition, internal medicine, infectious diseases, programme management, health-care administration, health economics, health communication, sociology, the EPR-TAG advises the WHO AFRO Regional Director on key issues. These include assessing the regional context of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies; conducting horizon scanning for new and emerging threats; providing strategic guidance on preparedness, response, and recovery strategies; reviewing progress in implementing regional health security initiatives; and strengthening country ownership and decision-making in emergency response.\\nThe EPR-TAG is chaired by Dr Deo Nshimirimana, a retired WHO medical doctor renowned for his expertise in immunization in emergency settings. Assisting him is Dr Rebecca Martin, Vice President of Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute, appointed as the Vice-Chairperson. Dr Martin brings decades of experience in health security, emergency response and immunization. Both leaders bring a wealth of experience in public health and will guide the EPR-TAG for an initial three-year term. \\\"The opportunity to lead the EPR-TAG is a great honour, and I am thrilled to be part of this transformative team. I am confident that our collective expertise will significantly contribute to enhancing Africa's preparedness and response capabilities, ensuring a more resilient defence against ongoing and future health threats. Together, we can make a substantial impact on the well-being of African nations.\\\" - Dr Deo Nshimirimana.\\nDr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, commented on the establishment of the EPR-TAG, stating: \\\"The Emergency Preparedness & Response technical group will play a critical role in strengthening our capacity, working collectively with partners, to support countries to prepare for, respond to, recover from public health emergencies while continuing to provide essential health care, across the African Region. I look forward, with our team, to leveraging its diverse expertise and independent perspective, for the benefit of our Member States.\\\"\\nThe inaugural meeting of this prestigious group is taking place in Saly, Senegal from 16 to 17 July 2024. This gathering marks a historic moment as the EPR-TAG begins its journey to enhance health security across the African region. The establishment of the EPR-TAG underlines WHO AFRO's commitment to building a stronger, more resilient African Region prepared to face any public health challenge. With its expert guidance and collaborative approach, the EPR-TAG will play a vital role in protecting the health and well-being of millions of people across the continent.\\nFor more information, please feel free to contact WHO via\\neprtag\\n[at]\\nwho.int\\n(eprtag[at]who[dot]int)\\nList of the WHO AFRO Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG) Members\\nName\\nNationality\\nDesignation\\n1\\nDeo NSHIMIRIMANA\\n(EPR-TAG Chairperson)\\nBurundi\\nPublic Health Consultant\\n2\\nRebecca MARTIN\\n(EPR-TAG Vice-Chairperson)\\nUSA\\nVice President, Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute\\n3\\nRick BRIGHT\\nUSA\\nCEO, Bright Global Health\\n4\\nDeoraj CAUSSY\\nMauritius\\nEpidemiologist, 360 Epidemiology Solutions\\n5\\nBernice DAHN\\nLiberia\\nVice President/Executive Dean, College of Health Sciences, University of Liberia\\n6\\nWafaa El-SADR\\nEgypt\\nFounder & Director, ICAP, Columbia University\\n7\\nNyasha GUZHA-CHANETSA\\nZimbabwe\\nChief State Veterinarian (Public Health & Trade Facilitation), South African Department of Agriculture, Rural Development & Environment\\n8\\nBanda KHALIFA\\nGhana\\nGlobal Health Expert and Managing Director, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Advancing Health Systems Innovations (CAdHSI)\\n9\\nRodrigue KOHOUN\\nBenin\\nPHC Technical Advisor to the Ministry of Health, Benin\\n10\\nAgnes MAHOMVA\\nZimbabwe\\nPublic Health Advisor to the President and Cabinet, Office of the President and Cabinet, Zimbabwe\\n11\\nBrice Wilfried BICABA\\nBurkina Faso\\nDirector General, Health & Public Hygiene, Ministry of Health, Burkina Faso\\n12\\nCheikh Tidiane MBOW\\nSenegal\\nChief, Health Promotion & Infectious Diseases Prevention Unit, MONUSCO (Goma\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) is a regional office of WHO focused on public health across African Member States, responsible for coordinating health initiatives, emergency preparedness, and response efforts.\\\"<|>\\\"the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) has established an Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG).

Sovereignty – Africa CDC\nSkip to content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nPress Releases\nHigh-level event kicks off expansion of strategic EU-AU partnership, pledging joint commitments to strengthen Global Health and African Health Sovereignty\nBrussels, March 19, 2024 –\nThe African Union Commission (AUC) and the European Union hosted a High-level Conference marking the expansion of the strategic EU-AU health partnership. The AU delegation was led by the AUC, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD). The EU delegation was led by the Belgian Presidency of the European Council and the European Commission.\nBuilding on the health commitments of the 6th EU-AU Summit and outcomes of the Addis Ababa AU-EU High-level dialogue, the AU and EU expanded collaboration in priority areas of common interest in the New Public Health Order and the EU Global Health Strategy, such as strengthening pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health, AMR, digital health, climate and health. This collaboration is a positive example of the AU-EU partnership to support global health in multilateral fora. Enhancing equitable access to safe, qualitive, effective and affordable health services and products and national sovereignty will be key to reach SDG-targets such as achieving Universal Health Coverage. Therefore, it is crucial to support social protection systems which incorporate social health protection, aiming at gradually granting universal health coverage as well as at providing income security in case of sickness. The AU and EU further stressed the importance of the health sector in the creation of jobs and growth. They also expressed their commitment to conclude negotiations on a pandemic agreement and International Health Regulations by the May 2024 World Health Assembly.\nMost African countries are struggling to ensure sustainable and equitable access to the health products needed to meet the continent’s priority health needs. At the same time, the EU has expertise in health as well as manufacturing and access, including regulation of health products and has set out clear targets in supporting human development in its international partnerships.\nWith this High-level conference, the EU engages in continued technical collaboration on health in Africa and investments in strengthening Africa’s health security architecture. The EU’s Global Gateway strategy will be key to deliver on these commitments, notably through Team Europe Initiatives, increasing the resilience of European and African health systems in response to the rapidly shifting health burden, social protection, the impact of climate change and emerging health threats while considering innovative science, sharing of technical expertise and knowledge (as well as multi-stakeholder commitments).\nThe Belgian Presidency and the European Commission will follow up on the high-level conference in the European Council and in the governing bodies of the EU’s international cooperation instruments, aligned with shared interests and ambitions of European and African partners.\nAfrican Union Commissioner for Health, Humanitarian Affairs and Social Development,\nH.E. Amb. Minata Samate Cessouma\n“\nThe establishment of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) marks a crucial step forward in safeguarding health security on the continent by ensuring the availability and the accessibility of quality pharmaceutical products. This availability and accessibility facilitate prevention strategies and rapid responses to health emergencies, strengthening regulatory capacities and promoting regional cooperation and harmonisation of standards. By harmonising regulatory processes and promoting access to effectual medical products, the AMA can significantly enhance public health outcomes and promote sustainable development in Africa, as envisioned in the Africa Health Strategy (2016-2030) and the African Union Agenda 2063. AMA is also envisioned to bolster research and development efforts within the continent, fostering innovation and self-reliance in addressing health challenges specific to the continent. Looking to the future, the African Union Commission is enthusiastic about knowledge-sharing between the European Union and Africa to leverage the experience of establishing the European Mediines Agency to chart guidance and regulatory pathways for the development and approval of new manufacturing technologies and processes.\nBelgian Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities,\nH.E. Caroline GENNEZ\n“\nThe EU and Africa express a shared vision of health as the precondition for social development. African countries have extensive experience in the containment of epidemics; European countries have some of the best and most accessible healthcare in the world. Global health is an area in which the EU offers added value as a partner to Africa based on its expertise and experience. Europe bolsters its international partnerships by focusing on its unique selling proposition. Our cooperation on this front will improve health outcomes for countless of people, in Africa and Europe. Our focus will be on building affordable, available and high-quality healthcare systems.\n”\nEuropean Commissioner for International Partnerships,\nH.E. Jutta URPILAINEN\n“\nLearning the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, the AU and the EU are committed to advance health systems and strengthen health capacities globally. This joint commitment was well reflected in the Global Gateway investment package, which we presented at the AU-EU Summit of 2022. We are proud of the results achieved in increasing local manufacturing of medicines and vaccines in Africa, for Africa. Today we launch three major Team Europe Initiatives on health security, digital health and public health institutes, and strengthen cooperation between our institutions. This is another step forward to better confront evolving health challenges and to enhance the resilience of our communities.\n”\nEuropean Commissioner for Health and Food Safety,\nH.E. Stella KYRIAKIDES\n“\nAn ever-closer partnership between the African Union and the European Union is indispensable for public health. We want to work more closely with our African partners on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health and anti-microbial resistance, as well as the health effects of climate change. These are core objectives for our EU Global Health Strategy and the foundations of our cooperation with the African continent. We are now at a critical stage of the negotiations on the\n######################\nOutput:",

pledging joint commitments to strengthen Global Health and African Health Sovereignty\\nBrussels, March 19, 2024 –\\nThe African Union Commission (AUC) and the European Union hosted a High-level Conference marking the expansion of the strategic EU-AU health partnership. The AU delegation was led by the AUC, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD). The EU delegation was led by the Belgian Presidency of the European Council and the European Commission.\\nBuilding on the health commitments of the 6th EU-AU Summit and outcomes of the Addis Ababa AU-EU High-level dialogue, the AU and EU expanded collaboration in priority areas of common interest in the New Public Health Order and the EU Global Health Strategy, such as strengthening pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health, AMR, digital health, climate and health. This collaboration is a positive example of the AU-EU partnership to support global health in multilateral fora. Enhancing equitable access to safe, qualitive, effective and affordable health services and products and national sovereignty will be key to reach SDG-targets such as achieving Universal Health Coverage. Therefore, it is crucial to support social protection systems which incorporate social health protection, aiming at gradually granting universal health coverage as well as at providing income security in case of sickness. The AU and EU further stressed the importance of the health sector in the creation of jobs and growth. They also expressed their commitment to conclude negotiations on a pandemic agreement and International Health Regulations by the May 2024 World Health Assembly.\\nMost African countries are struggling to ensure sustainable and equitable access to the health products needed to meet the continent’s priority health needs. At the same time, the EU has expertise in health as well as manufacturing and access, including regulation of health products and has set out clear targets in supporting human development in its international partnerships.\\nWith this High-level conference, the EU engages in continued technical collaboration on health in Africa and investments in strengthening Africa’s health security architecture. The EU’s Global Gateway strategy will be key to deliver on these commitments, notably through Team Europe Initiatives, increasing the resilience of European and African health systems in response to the rapidly shifting health burden, social protection, the impact of climate change and emerging health threats while considering innovative science, sharing of technical expertise and knowledge (as well as multi-stakeholder commitments).\\nThe Belgian Presidency and the European Commission will follow up on the high-level conference in the European Council and in the governing bodies of the EU’s international cooperation instruments, aligned with shared interests and ambitions of European and African partners.\\nAfrican Union Commissioner for Health, Humanitarian Affairs and Social Development,\\nH.E. Amb. Minata Samate Cessouma\\n“\\nThe establishment of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) marks a crucial step forward in safeguarding health security on the continent by ensuring the availability and the accessibility of quality pharmaceutical products. This availability and accessibility facilitate prevention strategies and rapid responses to health emergencies, strengthening regulatory capacities and promoting regional cooperation and harmonisation of standards. By harmonising regulatory processes and promoting access to effectual medical products, the AMA can significantly enhance public health outcomes and promote sustainable development in Africa, as envisioned in the Africa Health Strategy (2016-2030) and the African Union Agenda 2063. AMA is also envisioned to bolster research and development efforts within the continent, fostering innovation and self-reliance in addressing health challenges specific to the continent. Looking to the future, the African Union Commission is enthusiastic about knowledge-sharing between the European Union and Africa to leverage the experience of establishing the European Mediines Agency to chart guidance and regulatory pathways for the development and approval of new manufacturing technologies and processes.\\nBelgian Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities,\\nH.E. Caroline GENNEZ\\n“\\nThe EU and Africa express a shared vision of health as the precondition for social development. African countries have extensive experience in the containment of epidemics; European countries have some of the best and most accessible healthcare in the world. Global health is an area in which the EU offers added value as a partner to Africa based on its expertise and experience. Europe bolsters its international partnerships by focusing on its unique selling proposition. Our cooperation on this front will improve health outcomes for countless of people, in Africa and Europe. Our focus will be on building affordable, available and high-quality healthcare systems.\\n”\\nEuropean Commissioner for International Partnerships,\\nH.E. Jutta URPILAINEN\\n“\\nLearning the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, the AU and the EU are committed to advance health systems and strengthen health capacities globally. This joint commitment was well reflected in the Global Gateway investment package, which we presented at the AU-EU Summit of 2022. We are proud of the results achieved in increasing local manufacturing of medicines and vaccines in Africa, for Africa. Today we launch three major Team Europe Initiatives on health security, digital health and public health institutes, and strengthen cooperation between our institutions. This is another step forward to better confront evolving health challenges and to enhance the resilience of our communities.\\n”\\nEuropean Commissioner for Health and Food Safety,\\nH.E. Stella KYRIAKIDES\\n“\\nAn ever-closer partnership between the African Union and the European Union is indispensable for public health. We want to work more closely with our African partners on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health and anti-microbial resistance, as well as the health effects of climate change.

content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nArticles\nMpox outbreaks in Africa constitute a public health emergency of continental security\nOn Aug 13, 2024, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) declared mpox a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS) in Africa, acting under its mandate to address significant public health threats. This mandate was established in July, 2022, by the Executive Council of the Africa Union (AU) Assembly through its decision EX.CL/Dec.1169(XLI), empowering Africa CDC to coordinate responses to epidemics by mobilising African leaders, governments, and relevant agencies.\nThe decision was driven by the worsening mpox situation on the continent: since 2022, 40 874 cases and 1512 deaths have been reported across 15 AU member states. In 2024 alone, 17 541 cases and 517 deaths have been reported from 13 AU member states. These figures represent a 160% and 19% increase in the number of cases and deaths, respectively, in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. A 79% increase in the number of cases was observed in 2023 compared with 2022. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounts for 96% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported in 2024.\nInvestigations in the DRC suggest that heterosexual transmission, especially among female sex workers (9%), is driving the outbreak,\ncontrasting with the spread mainly among men who have sex with men in Europe in 2022. The high prevalence among women raises concerns about vertical transmission risks and adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nThe high risk of severe infection among people living with HIV, considerations for asymptomatic infections, poor vaccination strategies, limited access to medical countermeasures, and low detection rates were other concerns. The outbreak is further complicated by a high case fatality rate of over 3·9%, particularly among children younger than 15 years, who account for 60% of cases. Cross-border movements, low public awareness, high vulnerability due to factors such as HIV and malnutrition, limited understanding of mpox transmission, and insufficient response capacities, including vaccine shortages, pose significant challenges to containment. The risk of mpox spreading to neighbouring countries and globally is high.\nThe day before the PHECS announcement, 15 of the 20-member Emergency Consultative Group (ECG) met to advise the Africa CDC Director General on whether the mpox outbreak constituted a PHECS. The group redefined PHECS as a significant event posing a risk to other countries, requiring immediate continental-level action to prevent and mitigate disease spread—expanding the original definition in the Africa CDC statute.\nThey also developed specific criteria to assess the situation objectively. These criteria, organised into nine areas, included: disease severity, transmission dynamics, impact on health systems, vaccine and treatment availability, public health risk, economic and social impact, public concern, global health security, and political considerations (\ntable\n). The framework was developed to guide a transparent and consistent decision-making process for declaring a PHECS in Africa.\nRead more –\nMpox outbreaks in Africa constitute a public health emergency of continental security\n21 August 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\n,\nPublic Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS)\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nDiseases\nMpox\nTags\nMpox\n,\nMpox Vaccine\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

content\\nEmail:\\ncommunications@africacdc.org\\nSearch\\nSearch\\nNews\\n/\\nArticles\\nMpox outbreaks in Africa constitute a public health emergency of continental security\\nOn Aug 13, 2024, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) declared mpox a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS) in Africa, acting under its mandate to address significant public health threats. This mandate was established in July, 2022, by the Executive Council of the Africa Union (AU) Assembly through its decision EX.CL/Dec.1169(XLI), empowering Africa CDC to coordinate responses to epidemics by mobilising African leaders, governments, and relevant agencies.\\nThe decision was driven by the worsening mpox situation on the continent: since 2022, 40 874 cases and 1512 deaths have been reported across 15 AU member states. In 2024 alone, 17 541 cases and 517 deaths have been reported from 13 AU member states. These figures represent a 160% and 19% increase in the number of cases and deaths, respectively, in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. A 79% increase in the number of cases was observed in 2023 compared with 2022. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounts for 96% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported in 2024.\\nInvestigations in the DRC suggest that heterosexual transmission, especially among female sex workers (9%), is driving the outbreak,\\ncontrasting with the spread mainly among men who have sex with men in Europe in 2022. The high prevalence among women raises concerns about vertical transmission risks and adverse pregnancy outcomes.\\nThe high risk of severe infection among people living with HIV, considerations for asymptomatic infections, poor vaccination strategies, limited access to medical countermeasures, and low detection rates were other concerns. The outbreak is further complicated by a high case fatality rate of over 3·9%, particularly among children younger than 15 years, who account for 60% of cases. Cross-border movements, low public awareness, high vulnerability due to factors such as HIV and malnutrition, limited understanding of mpox transmission, and insufficient response capacities, including vaccine shortages, pose significant challenges to containment. The risk of mpox spreading to neighbouring countries and globally is high.\\nThe day before the PHECS announcement, 15 of the 20-member Emergency Consultative Group (ECG) met to advise the Africa CDC Director General on whether the mpox outbreak constituted a PHECS. The group redefined PHECS as a significant event posing a risk to other countries, requiring immediate continental-level action to prevent and mitigate disease spread—expanding the original definition in the Africa CDC statute.\\nThey also developed specific criteria to assess the situation objectively. These criteria, organised into nine areas, included: disease severity, transmission dynamics, impact on health systems, vaccine and treatment availability, public health risk, economic and social impact, public concern, global health security, and political considerations (\\ntable\\n). The framework was developed to guide a transparent and consistent decision-making process for declaring a PHECS in Africa.\\nRead more –\\nMpox outbreaks in Africa constitute a public health emergency of continental security\\n21 August 2024\\nTheme\\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\\n,\\nPublic Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS)\\nRegion\\nCentral Africa\\n,\\nEastern Africa\\n,\\nNorthern Africa\\n,\\nSouthern Africa\\n,\\nWestern Africa\\nDiseases\\nMpox\\nTags\\nMpox\\n,\\nMpox Vaccine\\nRelated Content\\nMedia Advisory\\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\\nPress Releases\\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\\nPress Releases\\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\\nFollow Us\\nTwitter\\nLinkedin\\nFacebook-f\\nYoutube\\nFlickr\\nInstagram\\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Africa\nNearly 10 000 children vaccinated as malaria vaccine rollout in Africa expands\nNearly 10 000 children vaccinated as malaria vaccine rollout in Africa expands\n09 February 2024\nBrazzaville –\nNearly 10 000 children in Burkina Faso and Cameroon have now received the RTS,S malaria vaccine since being introduced this year. A wider malaria vaccine rollout is underway this year in several African countries, with Cameroon being the first outside the malaria vaccine pilot programme to do so.\nCameroon launched the vaccine on 22 January 2024. It is being integrated into its national routine immunization programme in more than 500 public and private health facilities across 42 health districts in the country’s 10 regions.\nBurkina Faso introduced the vaccine on 5 February, becoming the latest country in the region to kick off the immunization. The game-changing vaccine complements the existing range of malaria control measures to prevent the disease and lower its burden.\n“Malaria is one of the major health challenges our region faces. The wider rollout of the malaria vaccine marks a significant milestone in advancing the fight against this deadly disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. “We’re committed to supporting countries to ensure that all eligible children are protected from the devastating impacts of this preventable illness.”\nThe vaccine rollout in the two countries mark the start of a major initiative by the WHO Regional Office for Africa’s Accelerated Malaria Vaccines Introduction and Rollout in Africa (AMVIRA).\nAMVIRA was developed as a response to the planned introduction of the two malaria vaccines (RTS,S and R21) into the routine immunization schedules of 19 countries\n[1]\nthe Africa region in 2024. Through AMVIRA, WHO in Africa will strengthen the provision of state-of-the-art support to countries in their efforts to effectively and efficiently introduce and rollout malaria vaccines. The initiative also enhances coordination with partners, UNICEF, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and other partners.\nIn support of countries to ensure smooth introduction, community understanding and acceptance, and strengthened logistics, WHO has deployed 69 experts in immunization, data science and communication, across all 10 regions in Cameroon, as well as in Burkina Faso.\nWHO is working with countries to set up comprehensive preparations such as national vaccination policy and guidelines, integrating the new vaccine into the delivery schedule of other vaccines and health interventions, developing an operational roll out plan, training of healthcare workers, investing in infrastructure, technical capacity, vaccine storage, community engagement and demand generation, and ensuring formative supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the process to ensure quality vaccine delivery.\nAs the malaria vaccine rollout extends to all eligible countries, WHO will continue to ensure that experts are deployed where needed, implement robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track progress, identify challenges and facilitate timely interventions where required. The effective strategies that were witnessed in Cameroon and Burkina Faso are being documented and will be shared with other countries as they prepare for and launch the vaccines.\nMalaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of related deaths in 2022. There were 249 million malaria cases globally in 2022, leading to 608 000 deaths. Of these deaths, 77% were children under 5 years of age, mostly in Africa.\n[1]\nBenin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Niger, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Mozambique, Nigeria and South Sudan\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\n######################\nOutput:",

Africa\\nNearly 10 000 children vaccinated as malaria vaccine rollout in Africa expands\\nNearly 10 000 children vaccinated as malaria vaccine rollout in Africa expands\\n09 February 2024\\nBrazzaville –\\nNearly 10 000 children in Burkina Faso and Cameroon have now received the RTS,S malaria vaccine since being introduced this year. A wider malaria vaccine rollout is underway this year in several African countries, with Cameroon being the first outside the malaria vaccine pilot programme to do so.\\nCameroon launched the vaccine on 22 January 2024. It is being integrated into its national routine immunization programme in more than 500 public and private health facilities across 42 health districts in the country’s 10 regions.\\nBurkina Faso introduced the vaccine on 5 February, becoming the latest country in the region to kick off the immunization. The game-changing vaccine complements the existing range of malaria control measures to prevent the disease and lower its burden.\\n“Malaria is one of the major health challenges our region faces. The wider rollout of the malaria vaccine marks a significant milestone in advancing the fight against this deadly disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. “We’re committed to supporting countries to ensure that all eligible children are protected from the devastating impacts of this preventable illness.”\\nThe vaccine rollout in the two countries mark the start of a major initiative by the WHO Regional Office for Africa’s Accelerated Malaria Vaccines Introduction and Rollout in Africa (AMVIRA).\\nAMVIRA was developed as a response to the planned introduction of the two malaria vaccines (RTS,S and R21) into the routine immunization schedules of 19 countries\\n[1]\\nthe Africa region in 2024. Through AMVIRA, WHO in Africa will strengthen the provision of state-of-the-art support to countries in their efforts to effectively and efficiently introduce and rollout malaria vaccines. The initiative also enhances coordination with partners, UNICEF, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and other partners.\\nIn support of countries to ensure smooth introduction, community understanding and acceptance, and strengthened logistics, WHO has deployed 69 experts in immunization, data science and communication, across all 10 regions in Cameroon, as well as in Burkina Faso.\\nWHO is working with countries to set up comprehensive preparations such as national vaccination policy and guidelines, integrating the new vaccine into the delivery schedule of other vaccines and health interventions, developing an operational roll out plan, training of healthcare workers, investing in infrastructure, technical capacity, vaccine storage, community engagement and demand generation, and ensuring formative supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the process to ensure quality vaccine delivery.\\nAs the malaria vaccine rollout extends to all eligible countries, WHO will continue to ensure that experts are deployed where needed, implement robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track progress, identify challenges and facilitate timely interventions where required. The effective strategies that were witnessed in Cameroon and Burkina Faso are being documented and will be shared with other countries as they prepare for and launch the vaccines.\\nMalaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of related deaths in 2022. There were 249 million malaria cases globally in 2022, leading to 608 000 deaths. Of these deaths, 77% were children under 5 years of age, mostly in Africa.\\n[1]\\nBenin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Niger, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Central

framework launched to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa\nNew framework launched to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa\n12 June 2024\nA new, comprehensive framework has been launched to guide health authorities, policy-makers and other stakeholders towards elimination of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as a public health problem in eastern Africa.\nAlso known as kala-azar, VL is a deadly parasitic disease that causes fever, weight loss, spleen and liver enlargement, and – if untreated – death. Transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies, VL is endemic in 80 countries around the world. In 2022, eastern Africa accounted for 73% of global VL cases, half of which occurred in children aged under 15 years.\nThe\nelimination framework\noutlines five main strategies for guiding VL elimination: (i) early diagnosis and treatment; (ii) integrated vector management; (iii) effective surveillance; (iv) advocacy, social mobilization and partnership-building; and (v) implementation and operational research. It also describes a stepwise process for implementing the main elimination phases and sets country and regional targets; these include a 90% reduction in VL burden in the eastern Africa sub-region to fewer than 1500 cases per year by 2030; detection and treatment of 90% of cases within 30 days of onset of symptoms by 2030; a 100% decline in VL deaths in children by 2030; 100% of VL–HIV patients started on antiretroviral therapy; and the detection, reporting and management of all post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) cases.\nRead more\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\n######################\nOutput:",

Africa\\nNew framework launched to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa\\nNew framework launched to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa\\n12 June 2024\\nA new, comprehensive framework has been launched to guide health authorities, policy-makers and other stakeholders towards elimination of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as a public health problem in eastern Africa.\\nAlso known as kala-azar, VL is a deadly parasitic disease that causes fever, weight loss, spleen and liver enlargement, and – if untreated – death. Transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies, VL is endemic in 80 countries around the world. In 2022, eastern Africa accounted for 73% of global VL cases, half of which occurred in children aged under 15 years.\\nThe\\nelimination framework\\noutlines five main strategies for guiding VL elimination: (i) early diagnosis and treatment; (ii) integrated vector management; (iii) effective surveillance; (iv) advocacy, social mobilization and partnership-building; and (v) implementation and operational research. It also describes a stepwise process for implementing the main elimination phases and sets country and regional targets; these include a 90% reduction in VL burden in the eastern Africa sub-region to fewer than 1500 cases per year by 2030; detection and treatment of 90% of cases within 30 days of onset of symptoms by 2030; a 100% decline in VL deaths in children by 2030; 100% of VL–HIV patients started on antiretroviral therapy; and the detection, reporting and management of all post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) cases.\\nRead more\\nClick image to enlarge\\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\\nCommunications and marketing officer\\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\\nEmail:\\nboakyeagyemangc\\n[at]\\nwho.int\\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"WHO\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The World Health Organization (WHO) is an international public health agency leading efforts to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as a public health problem in eastern Africa through launching new frameworks and coordinating regional health policies.\\\"<|>\\\"New framework launched to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa | WHO | Regional Office for Africa...WHO Africa\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Visceral Leishmaniasis\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a deadly parasitic disease transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies, causing fever, weight loss, spleen and liver enlargement, and death if untreated.

Africa CDC and WHO Strengthen Efforts to Safeguard Africa’s Health\nAfrica’s two leading public health institutions are seeking 1 billion USD for their partnership to respond to public health emergencies triggered by climate change and conflict-related disasters, aiming to build health security on the continent.\nAfrica CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) met on 27 May in Geneva, a year after launching the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) at the 76th World Health Assembly.\n“The JEAP is looking forward to mobilizing close to 1 billion USD to address critical gaps and strengthen the systems on the continent to better prepare, detect, and respond to health emergencies by 2027,” said Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC. “We think we can make it happen if we put our hands together,” he told the partners at the meeting.\nFor the first time, the JEAP partnership developed 17 multi-country and regional proposals for submission to the second round of the Pandemic Fund compared to fewer than three in the first round.\n“We are aware that the pandemic envelope is limited in meeting all needs, and that is why we are inviting you to join the JEAP movement,” said Dr. Kaseya.\nJEAP is a five-year strategic collaboration aimed at boosting emergency preparedness and response efforts throughout Africa, helping to ensure effective responses to disease outbreaks during humanitarian crises. On average, 100 disease outbreaks are reported annually in Africa.\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “JEAP will bolster our efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” she said.\nThe plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives, including the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order and WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030).\nJEAP prioritizes strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection, stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations, and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. They also plan to overcome supply chain barriers by reducing delays in delivering lifesaving supplies from 20 days to 24-48 hours, mitigating morbidity and mortality. The JEAP partnership welcomed UNICEF as the first partner to join this partnership, which holds great promise for transforming health security on the continent.\n29 May 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

USD | Africa CDC and WHO Strengthen Efforts to Safeguard Africa’s Health\\nAfrica’s two leading public health institutions are seeking 1 billion USD for their partnership to respond to public health emergencies triggered by climate change and conflict-related disasters, aiming to build health security on the continent.\\nAfrica CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) met on 27 May in Geneva, a year after launching the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) at the 76th World Health Assembly.\\n“The JEAP is looking forward to mobilizing close to 1 billion USD to address critical gaps and strengthen the systems on the continent to better prepare, detect, and respond to health emergencies by 2027,” said Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC. “We think we can make it happen if we put our hands together,” he told the partners at the meeting.\\nFor the first time, the JEAP partnership developed 17 multi-country and regional proposals for submission to the second round of the Pandemic Fund compared to fewer than three in the first round.\\n“We are aware that the pandemic envelope is limited in meeting all needs, and that is why we are inviting you to join the JEAP movement,” said Dr. Kaseya.\\nJEAP is a five-year strategic collaboration aimed at boosting emergency preparedness and response efforts throughout Africa, helping to ensure effective responses to disease outbreaks during humanitarian crises. On average, 100 disease outbreaks are reported annually in Africa.\\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “JEAP will bolster our efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” she said.\\nThe plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives, including the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order and WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030).\\nJEAP prioritizes strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection, stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations, and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. They also plan to overcome supply chain barriers by reducing delays in delivering lifesaving supplies from 20 days to 24-48 hours, mitigating morbidity and mortality. The JEAP partnership welcomed UNICEF as the first partner to join this partnership, which holds great promise for transforming health security on the continent.\\n29 May 2024\\nTheme\\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\\nRegion\\nCentral Africa\\n,\\nEastern Africa\\n,\\nNorthern Africa\\n,\\nSouthern Africa\\n,\\nWestern Africa\\nRelated Content\\nMedia Advisory\\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\\nPress Releases\\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\\nPress Releases\\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\\nFollow Us\\nTwitter\\nLinkedin\\nFacebook-f\\nYoutube\\nFlickr\\nInstagram\\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

charter to drive up investment in Africa’s health workforce\nPioneering charter to drive up investment in Africa’s health workforce\n25 April 2024\nBrazzaville –\nA pioneering health investment charter, a first for the African region, is set to be launched at the African Health Workforce Investment Forum which will take place in Windhoek, Namibia from 6 – 8 May 2024. Key stakeholders will gather to consolidate efforts to drive up investment to counter critical health worker shortages.\nWith a bold target of halving Africa’s critical 5.3-million health workforce shortage by 2030, the African Health Workforce Investment Charter will mobilize and align domestic and partner funding to strengthen, grow and retain the continent’s health workforce, especially in rural and primary health care settings.\n“Africa’s health worker sector is at a crossroads. The underinvestment in training and employing health workers, coupled with inadequate incentives to retain the workforce, has resulted in unfortunate levels of migration, both within and out of the continent.” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “It is time to urgently invest more and in smarter ways in our health workforce. Our future depends on it.”\nAddressing the gaps necessitates a continent-wide increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expenditure on health of up to 1.5%, with more than half of that dedicated to health workforce investment specifically.\nDespite a 13% improvement in efficiency between 2014 and 2019, African health systems remain only 77% efficient. In effect, this means that about US$1 in every US$5 spent on health is lost to technical inefficiencies, including health workforce management. This plays a significant role in the existence of ghost workers on payrolls, absenteeism and sub-optimal performance, for example.\nAt the upcoming forum, stakeholders will discuss the progress made in health workforce strengthening over the last 10 years and hammer out the details of new strategies to, among other things, protect health workforce budgets, address recurrent costs, and bolster investments amid existing domestic and global economic challenges, and debt concerns.\nThe forum will also engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.\nInvestment in the health workforce has multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, especially benefiting women and young people, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage.\nFor every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, noting that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%.\nAbout 170 participants are expected to attend the forum, including policy makers from the health, education, labour/employment and finance sectors, along with partners from civil society financing, bilateral and multilateral institutions.\nKey partners supporting the forum include the ILO-OECD-WHO Working for Health (W4H) Programme and its Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF), The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Frontline Health Workers Coalition.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\n######################\nOutput:",

Africa\\nPioneering charter to drive up investment in Africa’s health workforce\\nPioneering charter to drive up investment in Africa’s health workforce\\n25 April 2024\\nBrazzaville –\\nA pioneering health investment charter, a first for the African region, is set to be launched at the African Health Workforce Investment Forum which will take place in Windhoek, Namibia from 6 – 8 May 2024. Key stakeholders will gather to consolidate efforts to drive up investment to counter critical health worker shortages.\\nWith a bold target of halving Africa’s critical 5.3-million health workforce shortage by 2030, the African Health Workforce Investment Charter will mobilize and align domestic and partner funding to strengthen, grow and retain the continent’s health workforce, especially in rural and primary health care settings.\\n“Africa’s health worker sector is at a crossroads. The underinvestment in training and employing health workers, coupled with inadequate incentives to retain the workforce, has resulted in unfortunate levels of migration, both within and out of the continent.” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “It is time to urgently invest more and in smarter ways in our health workforce. Our future depends on it.”\\nAddressing the gaps necessitates a continent-wide increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expenditure on health of up to 1.5%, with more than half of that dedicated to health workforce investment specifically.\\nDespite a 13% improvement in efficiency between 2014 and 2019, African health systems remain only 77% efficient. In effect, this means that about US$1 in every US$5 spent on health is lost to technical inefficiencies, including health workforce management. This plays a significant role in the existence of ghost workers on payrolls, absenteeism and sub-optimal performance, for example.\\nAt the upcoming forum, stakeholders will discuss the progress made in health workforce strengthening over the last 10 years and hammer out the details of new strategies to, among other things, protect health workforce budgets, address recurrent costs, and bolster investments amid existing domestic and global economic challenges, and debt concerns.\\nThe forum will also engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.\\nInvestment in the health workforce has multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, especially benefiting women and young people, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Health Coverage.\\nFor every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, noting that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%.\\nAbout 170 participants are expected to attend the forum, including policy makers from the health, education, labour/employment and finance sectors, along with partners from civil society financing, bilateral and multilateral institutions.\\nKey partners supporting the forum include the ILO-OECD-WHO Working for Health (W4H) Programme and its Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF), The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Frontline Health Workers Coalition.\\nClick image to enlarge\\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please

The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is the continental public health agency mandated to support African member states in building robust and resilient health systems. Its mission is to safeguard Africa’s health security and accelerate the achievement of universal health coverage.\nAfrica CDC’s strategic focus is on three critical priorities: (1) outbreak and pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response; (2) health systems strengthening, with an emphasis on primary health care and community health; and (3) effective local manufacturing of health commodities, including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.\nAfrica CDC recognizes Gavi as a pivotal partner for health security and collective resilience to vaccine-preventable diseases across the continent. Indeed, from 2000 to 2022, Gavi invested US$11.9 billion to enhance access to life-saving vaccines in Africa, resulting in 11.1 million future deaths averted in Africa.\nThis week, the Gavi Board approved the Gavi Alliance’s new five-year strategy (2026-2030), focusing on accelerating vaccine coverage, introducing new vaccines, strengthening health systems for equity, and supporting global health security and regional vaccine manufacturing. As a public-private partnership, Gavi is funded through replenishment events hosted by donor governments to mobilize support from governments, philanthropies, the private sector, various institutions, civil society organizations, and individuals.In a show of commitment and support as the continent is the primary beneficiary of Gavi funds, Africa CDC and the African Union and African member states stand ready to fully support the 2024 replenishment event hosted by France in Paris on June 20th.\nThis 2024 replenishment meeting will be unique, highlighting Gavi’s support for Africa’s crucial agenda of local manufacturing, as endorsed by African Heads of State under the Africa CDC’s Platform for Harmonized Health Manufacturing in Africa (PHAHM). Indeed, Gavi will unveil a groundbreaking US$1 billion commitment over ten years through a new initiative called the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), aimed at bolstering African health security and sovereignty. At the Gavi Board meeting on June 7th, the Director General of Africa CDC, H.E. Dr Jean Kaseya, underscored the importance of respectful partnership and collaboration, stating, “Local manufacturing is the second independence of Africa because it impacts our health security and economic growth.\nAdditionally, Africa CDC will spearhead the Lusaka agenda to strengthen national leadership and partner coordination for effective implementation of the One Plan, One Budget, and One M&E Framework.\n“In recognition of AVMA’s significance to Africa, Dr. Kaseya announced that the popular launch of AVMA will occur on African soil in the coming weeks. This momentous occasion will bring together African leaders, Gavi, donors and partners, African Civil Society Organizations, and communities to reflect on and celebrate the journey toward Africa’s self-reliance in manufacturing vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.Together, we stand on the brink of a new era for Africa’s self-reliance in health security, driven by innovation, partnership, and a shared vision for a safer, healthier, and more prosperous Africa.\nAbout Africa CDC:\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (AfricaCDC) is the African Union’s continental autonomous public health agency that supports member states in strengthening health systems and improving surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

June\\n– The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is the continental public health agency mandated to support African member states in building robust and resilient health systems. Its mission is to safeguard Africa’s health security and accelerate the achievement of universal health coverage.\\nAfrica CDC’s strategic focus is on three critical priorities: (1) outbreak and pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response; (2) health systems strengthening, with an emphasis on primary health care and community health; and (3) effective local manufacturing of health commodities, including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.\\nAfrica CDC recognizes Gavi as a pivotal partner for health security and collective resilience to vaccine-preventable diseases across the continent. Indeed, from 2000 to 2022, Gavi invested US$11.9 billion to enhance access to life-saving vaccines in Africa, resulting in 11.1 million future deaths averted in Africa.\\nThis week, the Gavi Board approved the Gavi Alliance’s new five-year strategy (2026-2030), focusing on accelerating vaccine coverage, introducing new vaccines, strengthening health systems for equity, and supporting global health security and regional vaccine manufacturing. As a public-private partnership, Gavi is funded through replenishment events hosted by donor governments to mobilize support from governments, philanthropies, the private sector, various institutions, civil society organizations, and individuals.In a show of commitment and support as the continent is the primary beneficiary of Gavi funds, Africa CDC and the African Union and African member states stand ready to fully support the 2024 replenishment event hosted by France in Paris on June 20th.\\nThis 2024 replenishment meeting will be unique, highlighting Gavi’s support for Africa’s crucial agenda of local manufacturing, as endorsed by African Heads of State under the Africa CDC’s Platform for Harmonized Health Manufacturing in Africa (PHAHM). Indeed, Gavi will unveil a groundbreaking US$1 billion commitment over ten years through a new initiative called the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), aimed at bolstering African health security and sovereignty. At the Gavi Board meeting on June 7th, the Director General of Africa CDC, H.E. Dr Jean Kaseya, underscored the importance of respectful partnership and collaboration, stating, “Local manufacturing is the second independence of Africa because it impacts our health security and economic growth.\\nAdditionally, Africa CDC will spearhead the Lusaka agenda to strengthen national leadership and partner coordination for effective implementation of the One Plan, One Budget, and One M&E Framework.\\n“In recognition of AVMA’s significance to Africa, Dr. Kaseya announced that the popular launch of AVMA will occur on African soil in the coming weeks. This momentous occasion will bring together African leaders, Gavi, donors and partners, African Civil Society Organizations, and communities to reflect on and celebrate the journey toward Africa’s self-reliance in manufacturing vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.Together, we stand on the brink of a new era for Africa’s self-reliance in health security, driven by innovation, partnership, and a shared vision for a safer, healthier, and more prosperous Africa.\\nAbout Africa CDC:\\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (AfricaCDC) is the African Union’s continental autonomous public health agency that supports member states in strengthening health systems and improving surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

Africa\nSenegal, WHO launch regional emergency hub to bolster Africa’s response to health crises\nSenegal, WHO launch regional emergency hub to bolster Africa’s response to health crises\n14 December 2023\nDakar –\nThe Government of Senegal and World Health Organization (WHO) today inaugurated a regional health emergency hub in the Senegalese capital Dakar to further bolster the African region’s capacity to respond swiftly and effectively to health crises and save lives.\nBuilding on the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO in Africa has over the past two years worked closely with countries in the region to establish decentralized emergency response systems to ensure an effective response to health crises. Under a transformative initiative, the Organization has embarked on a mission to establish three emergency hubs in the region.\nThe WHO Regional Emergency Hub in Dakar launched today is the second of its kind after WHO and the Government of Kenya launched the Nairobi health emergency hub in 2022. A health emergency hub in Pretoria is planned to be launched in 2024.\n“This hub, with its various functions that include strategic pre-positioning of emergency health supplies, will enable the WHO Regional Office for Africa to support countries affected by health or humanitarian crises respond faster and in a more structured manner,” said Amadou Ba, Prime Minister of Senegal.\nThe African region faces the highest number of health emergencies globally each year. As of November 2023, the region was grappling with more than 130 disease outbreaks. In West Africa’s Sahel region, more than 33 million people across six countries currently require urgent need of life-saving humanitarian assistance.\nThe goal of the regional emergency hubs is to substantially reduce – from an average of 45 days previously to three days – the time it takes to deliver life-saving, effective emergency response to countries after a public health event has been declared. This is critical to make meaningful difference in the plight of people affected by crises and to effectively control and end disease outbreaks.\nThe health emergency hubs also serve as centres of excellence, aiming to train more than 3000 African experts, equipping them with key technical skills essential for effective response to health emergencies. Each of the three centres has a specialized function, capitalizing on the comparative advantages afforded by each host country.\n“I extend my heartfelt appreciation to all those who have contributed to establishing this essential facility,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Our work through this hub aligns with the current global dynamic towards emergency preparedness, vaccine manufacturing, supply chain and effective tools to better respond to public health crises.”\nThe Senegal hub specializes in supply chain management, data analysis, innovation and information management, the Kenya hub focuses on the development of emergency medical personnel, while that in south Africa specializes on research and development, and genomic surveillance.\nSince September 2022 when the temporary warehouse in Nairobi became operational the delivery time of critical emergency health supplies and equipment within the region has drastically reduced from at least three weeks to an average of three days. The deployment of responders has also been reduced.\nThe Government of Senegal has allocated five hectares of land for the construction of the Regional Emergency Hub in the outskirts of Dakar. The 8000-square-metre building has a 100-person office space. Additionally, the government has allocated 5000-square-metre container yard and is facilitating speedy custom clearance processes for inbound and outbound supplies.\nThe hubs in Kenya and Senegal feature a warehouse for prepositioning medical supplies and equipment, a state-of-the-art training facility, an infectious diseases unit, an emergency response simulation facility and a training camp for health emergency first responders.\nThe Regional Emergency Hubs will work in close cooperation with partners and the broader United Nations ecosystem to support countries. WHO is also collaborating closely with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\n######################\nOutput:",

content\\nWHO Africa\\nSenegal, WHO launch regional emergency hub to bolster Africa’s response to health crises\\nSenegal, WHO launch regional emergency hub to bolster Africa’s response to health crises\\n14 December 2023\\nDakar –\\nThe Government of Senegal and World Health Organization (WHO) today inaugurated a regional health emergency hub in the Senegalese capital Dakar to further bolster the African region’s capacity to respond swiftly and effectively to health crises and save lives.\\nBuilding on the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO in Africa has over the past two years worked closely with countries in the region to establish decentralized emergency response systems to ensure an effective response to health crises. Under a transformative initiative, the Organization has embarked on a mission to establish three emergency hubs in the region.\\nThe WHO Regional Emergency Hub in Dakar launched today is the second of its kind after WHO and the Government of Kenya launched the Nairobi health emergency hub in 2022. A health emergency hub in Pretoria is planned to be launched in 2024.\\n“This hub, with its various functions that include strategic pre-positioning of emergency health supplies, will enable the WHO Regional Office for Africa to support countries affected by health or humanitarian crises respond faster and in a more structured manner,” said Amadou Ba, Prime Minister of Senegal.\\nThe African region faces the highest number of health emergencies globally each year. As of November 2023, the region was grappling with more than 130 disease outbreaks. In West Africa’s Sahel region, more than 33 million people across six countries currently require urgent need of life-saving humanitarian assistance.\\nThe goal of the regional emergency hubs is to substantially reduce – from an average of 45 days previously to three days – the time it takes to deliver life-saving, effective emergency response to countries after a public health event has been declared. This is critical to make meaningful difference in the plight of people affected by crises and to effectively control and end disease outbreaks.\\nThe health emergency hubs also serve as centres of excellence, aiming to train more than 3000 African experts, equipping them with key technical skills essential for effective response to health emergencies. Each of the three centres has a specialized function, capitalizing on the comparative advantages afforded by each host country.\\n“I extend my heartfelt appreciation to all those who have contributed to establishing this essential facility,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Our work through this hub aligns with the current global dynamic towards emergency preparedness, vaccine manufacturing, supply chain and effective tools to better respond to public health crises.”\\nThe Senegal hub specializes in supply chain management, data analysis, innovation and information management, the Kenya hub focuses on the development of emergency medical personnel, while that in south Africa specializes on research and development, and genomic surveillance.\\nSince September 2022 when the temporary warehouse in Nairobi became operational the delivery time of critical emergency health supplies and equipment within the region has drastically reduced from at least three weeks to an average of three days. The deployment of responders has also been reduced.\\nThe Government of Senegal has allocated five hectares of land for the construction of the Regional Emergency Hub in the outskirts of Dakar. The 8000-square-metre building has a 100-person office space. Additionally, the government has allocated 5000-square-metre container yard and is facilitating speedy custom clearance processes for inbound and outbound supplies.\\nThe hubs in Kenya and Senegal feature a warehouse for prepositioning medical supplies and equipment, a state-of-the-art training facility, an infectious diseases unit, an emergency response simulation facility and a training camp for health emergency first responders.\\nThe Regional Emergency Hubs will work in close cooperation with partners and the broader United Nations ecosystem to support countries. WHO is also collaborating closely with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent.\\nClick image to enlarge\\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\\nCommunications and marketing officer\\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\\nEmail:\\nboakyeagyemangc\\n[at]\\nwho.int\\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Senegal\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Senegal is a country in West Africa and the host of the newly inaugurated WHO Regional Emergency Hub in its capital, Dakar.

content\nEmail:\ncommunications@africacdc.org\nSearch\nSearch\nNews\n/\nStories\nThe African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator is a Boon for the Continent\nThe Gavi Board’s approval of the Gavi Alliance’s new five-year strategy (2026-2030), which focuses on accelerating vaccine coverage, introducing new vaccines, strengthening health systems for equity, and supporting global health security and regional vaccine manufacturing, has given Africa CDC impetus on its quest for local vaccine manufacturing.\nOn 20 June 2024, a high-level event co-hosted in Paris by the Government of France, the African Union, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, along with the support of Team Europe, launched the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA). This initiative will provide financial incentives to help vaccine manufacturers in Africa scale up production and become sustainable on a long-term basis.\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance, launched its replenishment campaign asking for $9 billion in new pledges, out of a total need of $11.9 billion, with $2.9 billion available in existing donor pledges, investment income, and leftover resources from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gavi has received $2.4 billion in new pledges, with $1.58 billion of that coming from the United States.\n“Today is a great day for Africa, thanks to this event,” said Dr. Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC Director General, at the event. “This financing will continue to reduce the gap and increase fairness and equity,” he said. “We are launching AVMA today, which will allow us, between now and 2040, to produce 60% of our vaccines,” Dr. Kaseya added.\nHe also announced that Africa will organize a launching ceremony of AVMA in Africa for African leaders, partners, non-governmental organizations, and community organizations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to ensure regional diversification of vaccine manufacturing. A lack of local manufacturing capacity in Africa and other parts of the world meant that the African continent had to wait longer for vaccines to become available. “Our vision is not restricted to only producing vaccines locally but also covers the production of drugs, diagnostics, and other healing products,” Dr. Kaseya said.\n“With our Alliance on track to meet almost all of the goals we set for 2025, we need also to consider how we can accelerate our progress and broaden the protection we can provide to populations for the rest of this decade,” said Professor José Manuel Barroso, Chair of the Board of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “As Gavi sets these ambitious goals, I am grateful for the leadership of France, the African Union, and Africa CDC as we make the case for investing in immunization and strengthening global health security.”\nMeanwhile, on the sidelines of the Global Forum for Vaccine Sovereignty and Innovation in Paris, France, the Africa CDC and African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) renewed their partnership with a new cooperation agreement announced on 20 June. Through this collaboration, Afreximbank committed a USD 2 billion facility to the “Africa Health Security Investment Plan” to support the health product manufacturing ambition of the continent. This initiative will focus on the African Pooled Procurement Mechanism (APPM) and the Platform for Harmonized African Health Products Manufacturing (PHAHM). It also intends to complement GAVI’s innovative financing mechanism, the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), which is set to provide up to USD 1 billion in financing to African manufacturers of health and pharmaceutical products over the next ten years.\n28 June 2024\nTheme\nAVMA\n,\nAfrican Vaccine Manufacturing\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

content\\nEmail:\\ncommunications@africacdc.org\\nSearch\\nSearch\\nNews\\n/\\nStories\\nThe African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator is a Boon for the Continent\\nThe Gavi Board’s approval of the Gavi Alliance’s new five-year strategy (2026-2030), which focuses on accelerating vaccine coverage, introducing new vaccines, strengthening health systems for equity, and supporting global health security and regional vaccine manufacturing, has given Africa CDC impetus on its quest for local vaccine manufacturing.\\nOn 20 June 2024, a high-level event co-hosted in Paris by the Government of France, the African Union, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, along with the support of Team Europe, launched the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA). This initiative will provide financial incentives to help vaccine manufacturers in Africa scale up production and become sustainable on a long-term basis.\\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance, launched its replenishment campaign asking for $9 billion in new pledges, out of a total need of $11.9 billion, with $2.9 billion available in existing donor pledges, investment income, and leftover resources from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gavi has received $2.4 billion in new pledges, with $1.58 billion of that coming from the United States.\\n“Today is a great day for Africa, thanks to this event,” said Dr. Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC Director General, at the event. “This financing will continue to reduce the gap and increase fairness and equity,” he said. “We are launching AVMA today, which will allow us, between now and 2040, to produce 60% of our vaccines,” Dr. Kaseya added.\\nHe also announced that Africa will organize a launching ceremony of AVMA in Africa for African leaders, partners, non-governmental organizations, and community organizations.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to ensure regional diversification of vaccine manufacturing. A lack of local manufacturing capacity in Africa and other parts of the world meant that the African continent had to wait longer for vaccines to become available. “Our vision is not restricted to only producing vaccines locally but also covers the production of drugs, diagnostics, and other healing products,” Dr. Kaseya said.\\n“With our Alliance on track to meet almost all of the goals we set for 2025, we need also to consider how we can accelerate our progress and broaden the protection we can provide to populations for the rest of this decade,” said Professor José Manuel Barroso, Chair of the Board of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “As Gavi sets these ambitious goals, I am grateful for the leadership of France, the African Union, and Africa CDC as we make the case for investing in immunization and strengthening global health security.”\\nMeanwhile, on the sidelines of the Global Forum for Vaccine Sovereignty and Innovation in Paris, France, the Africa CDC and African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) renewed their partnership with a new cooperation agreement announced on 20 June. Through this collaboration, Afreximbank committed a USD 2 billion facility to the “Africa Health Security Investment Plan” to support the health product manufacturing ambition of the continent. This initiative will focus on the African Pooled Procurement Mechanism (APPM) and the Platform for Harmonized African Health Products Manufacturing (PHAHM). It also intends to complement GAVI’s innovative financing mechanism, the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), which is set to provide up to USD 1 billion in financing to African manufacturers of health and pharmaceutical products over the next ten years.\\n28 June 2024\\nTheme\\nAVMA\\n,\\nAfrican Vaccine Manufacturing\\nRegion\\nCentral Africa\\n,\\nEastern Africa\\n,\\nNorthern Africa\\n,\\nSouthern Africa\\n,\\nWestern Africa\\nRelated Content\\nMedia Advisory\\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\\nPress Releases\\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\\nPress Releases\\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\\nWeekly Briefs\\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\\nFollow Us\\nTwitter\\nLinkedin\\nFacebook-f\\nYoutube\\nFlickr\\nInstagram\\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

pursue collaboration to leverage data analytics to fight diseases\n12 January 2024\nBrazzaville -\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) have committed to strengthening collaboration towards the use of data analytics in the fight against diseases in the African region.\nThe commitment was made during a technical visit to the WHO Africa office in Brazzaville, Congo by a delegation from BMGF led by Jennifer Gardy, Deputy Director, Surveillance, Data, and Epidemiology from 8 to 10 January 2024.\nThe visit provided a platform for the delegation to understand how the WHO Regional Office for Africa’s Precision Public Health Metrics (PPHM) programme is strengthening health and disease modelling in Africa.\nThe PPHM unit was set up as a cross-cutting team within the Universal Health Coverage Communicable and Noncommunicable Diseases (UCN) Cluster in WHO Africa to support all programme areas with data analytics to control, eradicate and eliminate diseases in the African region.\n“Through precision public health, we are poised to deploy analytics to drive evidence and investments for public health interventions. We welcome the opportunity to build synergies with BMFG and other partners in this effort to leverage data in the fight against diseases,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nDiscussions during the engagement centered on the alignment between the vision and strategies of the UCN cluster and the BMGF, and how this can inform the work of the PPHM programme as it works to support and enhance the use of data analytics at both regional and country level.\nFurthermore, the WHO Africa Regional Office and BMFG express commitment to continue to work closely, through the UCN Cluster and PPHM, to support the many areas identified for collaboration, with an initial focus on the eradication of malaria in the region.\n“We recognize the need to leverage data for public health decision-making. We are looking forward to building synergies with the WHO Africa Regional Office to support countries in the region in their efforts to use data-informed solutions to fight disease,” says Jennifer Gardy.\nPPH was established as a special strategic initiative to deepen the precision public health for Africa (PPH4Africa) strategic initiative, advancing the deployment of analytics towards health systems strengthening and response. This vision is aligned with ongoing efforts to strengthen capacity on epidemiological modelling for public health decision-making in sub-Saharan Africa, already supported by BMFG.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nNyandoh Paho TADFOR\nCommunication Officer\nRegional Office for Africa\nEmail:\nnyandoht\n[at]\nwho.int\n(nyandoht[at]who[dot]int)\n######################\nOutput:",

We welcome the opportunity to build synergies with BMFG and other partners in this effort to leverage data in the fight against diseases,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.\\nDiscussions during the engagement centered on the alignment between the vision and strategies of the UCN cluster and the BMGF, and how this can inform the work of the PPHM programme as it works to support and enhance the use of data analytics at both regional and country level.\\nFurthermore, the WHO Africa Regional Office and BMFG express commitment to continue to work closely, through the UCN Cluster and PPHM, to support the many areas identified for collaboration, with an initial focus on the eradication of malaria in the region.\\n“We recognize the need to leverage data for public health decision-making. We are looking forward to building synergies with the WHO Africa Regional Office to support countries in the region in their efforts to use data-informed solutions to fight disease,” says Jennifer Gardy.\\nPPH was established as a special strategic initiative to deepen the precision public health for Africa (PPH4Africa) strategic initiative, advancing the deployment of analytics towards health systems strengthening and response. This vision is aligned with ongoing efforts to strengthen capacity on epidemiological modelling for public health decision-making in sub-Saharan Africa, already supported by BMFG.\\nClick image to enlarge\\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\\nNyandoh Paho TADFOR\\nCommunication Officer\\nRegional Office for Africa\\nEmail:\\nnyandoht\\n[at]\\nwho.int\\n(nyandoht[at]who[dot]int)\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The WHO Regional Office for Africa is a regional branch of the World Health Organization focused on health and disease control in the African region, leading initiatives such as the Precision Public Health Metrics programme to leverage data analytics for disease eradication and public health improvement.\\\"<|>\\\"The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) have committed to strengthening collaboration...The PPHM unit was set up as a cross-cutting team within the Universal Health Coverage Communicable and Noncommunicable Diseases (UCN) Cluster in WHO Africa...”)##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a global philanthropic organization engaged in funding and supporting health initiatives, including collaborating with WHO Africa to advance data analytics for fighting diseases and supporting epidemiological modelling in sub-Saharan Africa.\\\"<|>\\\"The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) have committed to strengthening collaboration...supported by BMFG...\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Jennifer Gardy\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Jennifer Gardy is the Deputy Director of Surveillance, Data, and Epidemiology at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation who led the delegation during a technical visit to WHO Africa to enhance collaboration on data analytics for disease control.\\\"<|>\\\"a delegation from BMGF led by Jennifer Gardy, Deputy Director, Surveillance, Data, and Epidemiology from 8 to 10 January 2024...

main content\nWHO Africa\nWHO Africa welcomes Gavi’s commitment to Africa vaccine manufacture, immunization and pandemic preparedness\nWHO Africa welcomes Gavi’s commitment to Africa vaccine manufacture, immunization and pandemic preparedness\n12 December 2023\nBrazzaville\n– The quest to protect Africa from vaccine-preventable diseases has received a significant boost, with the commitment of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to invest US$ 1.8 billion to support  African vaccine manufacturing, catching up missed children and pandemic preparedness.\nThe decision taken last week by the Gavi Board at its meeting in Accra, Ghana will help the continent to recover from the impact COVID-19 pandemic and be better prepared to respond to future public health emergencies.\nThis commitment comes at an opportune time when the sub-Saharan African region is witnessing stalled progress in immunization coverage, with the number of African children missing routine vaccinations rising from 6.2 million in 2019 to  7.8 million in 2022, translating into 2.8 million zero-dose children from 2019 to 2022 cumulatively.\nFurthermore, the establishment of the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), a financing instrument that will make up to US$1 billion, will strengthen ongoing efforts towards local vaccine manufacturing and address vaccine equity gaps identified during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“The pandemic highlighted beyond any doubt the critical importance of vaccination as a public health tool. This decision by the Board of Gavi will contribute significantly to saving lives and livelihoods,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nAt the 2023 WHO Africa Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group (RITAG) and the Immunization Stakeholders meeting, experts shared their commitment to advance efforts toward the attainment of global immunization. Therefore, through  WHO’s coordination role, the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF), which facilitated the regulatory environment required for COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the RITAG have been positioned and ready to support these commitments by Gavi for a deepened outcome.\nThe WHO Regional Office for Africa also welcomes the decision by  Gavi to translate lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic into concrete public health interventions, with a US$ 500 million investment to ensure the availability of funds for a future pandemic.\nThe lessons learned from decades of fighting and preventing diseases, including most recently,  COVID-19 have led to the vision and strategies, articulated in WHO Africa Regional Office’s Ending Disease in Africa: vision, strategies and Special Initiatives, 2023-2030, which will drive the work moving forward, including the vital acceleration of immunization uptake across the region.\nAnchored on this new strategy, WHO has supported countries in Africa in the development of innovative country plans to catch up with children who missed routine immunization.\nThis new strategy aligns with Gavi’s focus on protecting the next generation — particularly zero-dose children — through strengthening regional and country capacities on immunization and other diagnostics and therapeutics.\n“For us as WHO, serving about a billion people in 47 African countries, we welcome the opportunity to strengthen our ongoing collaboration with Gavi, Africa CDC and other partners to translate this latest commitment into action towards ending diseases in Africa,” Dr Moeti said.\nFor more information on the fight against diseases in Africa, see related links.\nEnding diseases in Africa\nStatus of Immunization in Africa\nThe roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa\nCountry Profiles on Immunization Coverage in the African Region\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nSayibu Ibrahim Suhuyini\nCommunications Officer\nWHO Ghana Country Office\nEmail:\nsayibui\n[at]\nwho.int\n(sayibui[at]who[dot]int)\nTel: +233 25 795 7942\nNyandoh Paho TADFOR\nCommunication Officer\nRegional Office for Africa\nEmail:\nnyandoht\n[at]\nwho.int\n(nyandoht[at]who[dot]int)\n######################\nOutput:",

manufacture, immunization and pandemic preparedness\\n12 December 2023\\nBrazzaville\\n– The quest to protect Africa from vaccine-preventable diseases has received a significant boost, with the commitment of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to invest US$ 1.8 billion to support  African vaccine manufacturing, catching up missed children and pandemic preparedness.\\nThe decision taken last week by the Gavi Board at its meeting in Accra, Ghana will help the continent to recover from the impact COVID-19 pandemic and be better prepared to respond to future public health emergencies.\\nThis commitment comes at an opportune time when the sub-Saharan African region is witnessing stalled progress in immunization coverage, with the number of African children missing routine vaccinations rising from 6.2 million in 2019 to  7.8 million in 2022, translating into 2.8 million zero-dose children from 2019 to 2022 cumulatively.\\nFurthermore, the establishment of the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), a financing instrument that will make up to US$1 billion, will strengthen ongoing efforts towards local vaccine manufacturing and address vaccine equity gaps identified during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n“The pandemic highlighted beyond any doubt the critical importance of vaccination as a public health tool. This decision by the Board of Gavi will contribute significantly to saving lives and livelihoods,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.\\nAt the 2023 WHO Africa Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group (RITAG) and the Immunization Stakeholders meeting, experts shared their commitment to advance efforts toward the attainment of global immunization. Therefore, through  WHO’s coordination role, the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF), which facilitated the regulatory environment required for COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the RITAG have been positioned and ready to support these commitments by Gavi for a deepened outcome.\\nThe WHO Regional Office for Africa also welcomes the decision by  Gavi to translate lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic into concrete public health interventions, with a US$ 500 million investment to ensure the availability of funds for a future pandemic.\\nThe lessons learned from decades of fighting and preventing diseases, including most recently,  COVID-19 have led to the vision and strategies, articulated in WHO Africa Regional Office’s Ending Disease in Africa: vision, strategies and Special Initiatives, 2023-2030, which will drive the work moving forward, including the vital acceleration of immunization uptake across the region.\\nAnchored on this new strategy, WHO has supported countries in Africa in the development of innovative country plans to catch up with children who missed routine immunization.\\nThis new strategy aligns with Gavi’s focus on protecting the next generation — particularly zero-dose children — through strengthening regional and country capacities on immunization and other diagnostics and therapeutics.\\n“For us as WHO, serving about a billion people in 47 African countries, we welcome the opportunity to strengthen our ongoing collaboration with Gavi, Africa CDC and other partners to translate this latest commitment into action towards ending diseases in Africa,” Dr Moeti said.\\nFor more information on the fight against diseases in Africa, see related links.\\nEnding diseases in Africa\\nStatus of Immunization in Africa\\nThe

    "return": "# Current Overall Situation of Biosafety in Africa\n\nThe biosafety situation in Africa is characterized by significant challenges and ongoing efforts to strengthen public health responses to infectious diseases and health emergencies. Africa CDC, as the continental public health agency, plays a crucial role in coordinating disease surveillance, outbreak response, emergency preparedness, and promoting health security across the continent.\n\n## Emergency Response and Preparedness\n\nAfrica CDC actively operates in multiple African regions including Central Africa, Eastern Africa, Northern Africa, Southern Africa, and Western Africa. The agency coordinates emergency response and preparedness initiatives to rapidly detect, contain, and mitigate outbreaks such as the mpox epidemic declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS) in August 2024. Challenges such as low public awareness, limited understanding of disease transmission, vaccine shortages, and insufficient response capacities hinder control efforts. Africa CDC has established mechanisms like the Emergency Consultative Group (ECG) to advise on health emergencies and ensure coordinated continental actions (DC #4, R #1, #3, #5, #6, #17, #18, #52).\n\n## Surveillance and Genomic Activities\n\nBiosafety measures are reinforced by pathogen genomic surveillance activities led by Africa CDC's Institute for Pathogen Genomics and the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative. These efforts enhance disease detection and understanding of microbial threats to guide public health interventions. Regional pathogen genomic activities span various African subregions, contributing to a comprehensive biosafety framework (R #23, #25, #26, DC #1).\n\n## Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\n\nAntimicrobial resistance presents a grave biosafety threat, exceeding mortality from diseases like HIV-AIDS, TB, and malaria in Africa. The continent faces a high burden of AMR due to misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals, and food systems. Surveillance gaps exist; for example, only 1.3% of microbiology labs in certain member states can test for key AMR pathogens. African institutions including the African Society for Laboratory Medicine and AU-IBAR emphasize strengthening laboratory capacities and multisectoral approaches to combat AMR effectively. This includes integrating human, animal, and environmental health aspects in line with the One Health framework, which is supported by African health ministers and partners (DC #6, R #2, #12, #14, #22, #28-31, #35).\n\n## Partnerships and Regulatory Improvements\n\nInternational partnerships, including with WHO, European Union, and CEPI, underpin Africa’s biosafety strategies. Efforts focus on sustainable vaccine development, equitable access to medical countermeasures, vaccine safety protocols, and regulatory harmonization to accelerate product approvals. Africa CDC advocates for improved regulatory pathways including WHO's Emergency Use Listing Procedure to facilitate timely access to innovative health products. Five African countries have achieved maturity level 3 (ML3) regulatory status, promoting local manufacturing oversight and biosafety compliance (DC #3, #10; R #19, #39, #40, #44, #54).\n\n## Communication and Information Sharing\n\nTo enhance biosafety, Africa CDC disseminates regular updates through weekly briefs, media advisories, and press releases, ensuring stakeholders and the public remain informed on emerging risks and response measures. The Africa Taskforce for Mpox Coordination exemplifies the continent’s commitment to rapid information sharing and coordinated actions against infectious threats (R #11, #15, #16, #41, #43, #46, #59).\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe current biosafety situation in Africa is marked by a high burden of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance threats, challenged by inadequate laboratory capacities and public awareness. However, the continent is making strides through strengthened surveillance, genomic research, coordinated emergency response, regulatory improvements, multisectoral collaborations, and robust communication efforts led by Africa CDC and partners to build resilient health systems and safeguard public health.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- africa-cdc-and-cepi-deepen-partnership-to-fortify-african-preparedness-against-disease-outbreaks [E/R/DC 1]  \n- communique-united-in-the-fight-against-mpox-in-africa-high-level-emergency-regional-meeting [E/R/DC 2, 8]  \n- mpox-outbreaks-in-africa-constitute-a-public-health-emergency-of-continental-security [E/R/DC 4]  \n- forging-resilience-who-afro-establishes-independent-expert-body-bolster-africas-health [E/R/DC 5]  \n- antimicrobial-resistance-is-a-greater-threat-than-hiv-aids-tb-and-malaria-says-new-report [E/R/DC 6]  \n- high-level-event-kicks-off-expansion-of-strategic-eu-au-partnership-pledging-joint-commitments-to-strengthen-global-health-and-african-health-sovereignty [E/R/DC 3, 10]  \n- addressing-regulatory-challenges-to-advance-local-manufacturing-in-africa [E/R/DC 10]  \n- africa-cdc-launches-initiatives-to-advance-molecular-diagnostics-and-genomic-surveillance-in-africa [E/R/DC 1, 23, 25, 26, 28, 34, 56]  \n- africa-cdc-and-eu-join-efforts-to-improve-equitable-access-to-health-products-and-local-manufacturing-for-africa [E/R/DC 44]",

    "return": "# Risks Facing Biosafety in Africa and Their Key Aspects\n\nBiosafety in Africa faces several critical risk points, encompassing various infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, vaccine supply challenges, and genomic surveillance efforts. Below is a detailed summary:\n\n## Infectious Diseases and Epidemics\nAfrica CDC has identified recurring outbreaks and epidemics of infectious diseases as a major biosafety risk. Particular attention is given to diseases such as mpox (monkeypox), which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security due to its high transmissibility, significant mortality, and socio-economic impact. Mpox outbreaks notably affect Central and West African countries, with complexities added by factors such as HIV co-infection, malnutrition, limited vaccine availability, and insufficient public health response capacities. The disease's changing transmission dynamics and high fatality among vulnerable groups, including children, pose ongoing challenges.\n\n## Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\nAMR represents one of the gravest threats to health security in Africa, surpassing mortality rates from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. It involves pathogens becoming resistant to antimicrobial drugs, driven by misuse and overuse in healthcare, agriculture, and food systems. This leads to treatment failures, increased disease spread, and heightened mortality, particularly threatening children and other vulnerable populations. Surveillance and diagnostic capacity for AMR remain limited, with only a small fraction of microbiology laboratories capable of testing for key resistant pathogens. AMR also poses risks to food safety and economy, requiring multi-sectoral responses.\n\n## Vaccine Supply and Manufacturing Challenges\nLocal vaccine manufacturing capacity is a strategic priority for Africa CDC to reduce reliance on external sources and enhance health security. Current risks include limited commercial-scale production facilities, fragmented markets, unpredictable demand, and weak national regulatory environments. Africa CDC supports initiatives such as the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator and the African Pooled Procurement Mechanism to improve vaccine availability, quality assurance, regulatory harmonization, and procurement strategies. Strengthening cold chain systems and expanding vaccine storage capacity across member states also form essential components of mitigating biosafety risks related to immunization.\n\n## Genomic Surveillance and Pathogen Monitoring\nStrengthening molecular diagnostics and pathogen genomic surveillance is crucial for early detection, outbreak response, and disease control. Africa CDC, through the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative and partnerships with organizations like WHO and APHF, advances efforts to build resilient genomic monitoring systems. These activities span across African regions and aim to improve laboratory infrastructure, data sharing, and rapid risk assessment capabilities. Effective genomic surveillance supports managing both endemic and emerging infectious threats.\n\n# Summary\nThe main biosafety risks in Africa revolve around managing endemic and emerging infectious diseases like mpox, combating the accelerating threat of antimicrobial resistance, overcoming vaccine supply and manufacturing constraints, and enhancing genomic surveillance infrastructure. Coordinated continental and regional initiatives led by Africa CDC and partners target these areas to bolster health security and outbreak preparedness.\n\n---\n\n### References\n- \"Mpox outbreaks in Africa constitute a public health emergency of continental security\" [DC #3]  \n- \"Antimicrobial Resistance is a Greater Threat than HIV-AIDS, TB and Malaria, Says New Report\" [DC #10]  \n- \"African Health Ministers Commit to Purchasing Locally-Made Vaccines\" [DC #1]  \n- \"Africa CDC and CEPI deepen partnership to fortify African preparedness against disease outbreaks\" [DC #2]  \n- Relationships involving Africa CDC, AMR, Mpox, Vaccine manufacturing, and Pathogen Genomic surveillance [R #1, #2, #16, #17, #18, #19, #42, #43, #59]",

    "return": "# Key Biosafety Risk Points in Africa\n\nAfrica faces several critical biosafety risk points that threaten public health and require multi-sectoral and coordinated responses.\n\n## Natural Zoonotic Diseases: Mpox (Monkeypox)\n\nMpox, also known as monkeypox, is an endemic viral infectious disease in 12 African countries, primarily in Central and West Africa. Since 2022, there has been a significant increase in mpox cases and deaths in Africa, with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) accounting for the majority. The outbreak is characterized by high transmissibility, notably via heterosexual transmission among female sex workers in the DRC, raising risks such as vertical transmission and severe infections especially in children and people living with HIV. Challenges in containment relate to insufficient response capacities, vaccine shortages, low public awareness, limited understanding of transmission modes, and population vulnerability due to factors like HIV and malnutrition. Cross-border movement facilitates the spread of mpox to neighboring countries, complicating control efforts. (DC #2, #3, #5)\n\n## Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\n\nAMR is a significant biosafety threat in Africa, with the continent experiencing the highest mortality rates from drug-resistant infections, surpassing deaths from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. AMR develops when microorganisms acquire resistance to antimicrobial drugs, often accelerated by misuse in healthcare and agriculture. The impact spans human health, livestock production, food security, and economies. Surveillance is still limited, with only 1.3% of microbiology labs in 14 member states capable of testing key AMR pathogens. Funding and resource allocation for AMR response remain inadequate, impeding progress. Urgent actions include strengthening leadership, expanding surveillance, promoting responsible antimicrobial use, and improving public and animal health systems. (DC #1, E #1, #25, #28, #34)\n\n## Laboratory Diagnostic and Surveillance Capacities\n\nLaboratory systems and networks are critical for early detection and monitoring of disease outbreaks, including mpox and AMR pathogens. However, diagnostic capacity is limited, with very low percentages of labs capable of key pathogen testing. Africa CDC collaborates with organizations like the African Society for Laboratory Medicine to enhance laboratory surveillance capacities. Efforts are ongoing to decentralize diagnostics, strengthen molecular diagnostic capabilities, and advance pathogen genomic surveillance through initiatives such as the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative to improve outbreak detection and response. (DC #9, #1; E #36, #38, #39)\n\n## Biotechnology Regulation and Health Product Access\n\nThe African Medicines Agency (AMA) and partnerships with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) aim to strengthen regulatory frameworks for health product approvals. However, regulatory approval processes remain fragmented and lengthy, which delays market access for vaccines and therapeutics. Regulatory harmonization and efficient pathways are essential for accelerating medical countermeasures availability. Strengthening local manufacturing capacity, supported by Africa CDC and partners, also addresses dependency on external sources for medicines and vaccines. (DC #6, #10; E #20, #21, #30)\n\n## Cross-Border Movement and Pandemic Risk\n\nPopulation movement across national borders in Africa significantly increases the risk of infectious disease spread, especially for diseases like mpox. This mobility challenges containment, calling for coordinated cross-border surveillance, legal and regulatory frameworks to facilitate rapid deployment of public health experts, and harmonized response strategies among African Union member states. International Health Regulations (2005) guide the monitoring and information exchange to maintain health security. (DC #3, #2; E #13, #37, #19)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAfrica's key biosafety risks include endemic zoonotic diseases like mpox with complex transmission dynamics and high vulnerability factors, escalating antimicrobial resistance threatening human and animal health, limitations in diagnostic and surveillance laboratory capacity, fragmented biotechnology regulatory processes hindering timely access to medical countermeasures, and challenges posed by cross-border population movements facilitating disease spread. Concerted efforts involving Africa CDC, African Union, WHO, regional partners, and international collaborators are focused on strengthening surveillance, laboratory capacity, regulatory harmonization, and coordinated emergency response to address these biosafety threats effectively.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- antimicrobial-resistance-is-a-greater-threat-than-hiv-aids-tb-and-malaria-says-new-report [DC #1];  \n- mpox-outbreaks-in-africa-constitute-a-public-health-emergency-of-continental-security [DC #2, #3, #5];  \n- africa-cdc-launches-initiatives-to-advance-molecular-diagnostics-and-genomic-surveillance-in-africa [DC #9];  \n- high-level-event-kicks-off-expansion-of-strategic-eu-au-partnership-pledging-joint-commitments-to-strengthen-global-health-and-african-health-sovereignty [DC #6];  \n- africa-cdc-and-eu-join-efforts-to-improve-equitable-access-to-health-products-and-local-manufacturing-for-africa [DC #10];  \n- Entities: 1, 5, 13, 20, 21, 25, 28, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41.",

    "return": "### Current Biosafety Situation in African Countries\n\nThe biosafety situation across African countries is complex and involves multiple challenges and initiatives. Notably, the continent faces a high burden of infectious diseases and public health emergencies that demand robust emergency response and preparedness systems. One significant concern is antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which poses a greater health threat in Africa than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. AMR is exacerbated by factors such as misuse of antimicrobials in healthcare, agriculture, and food systems and insufficient laboratory capacity for pathogen detection and surveillance—the latter evidenced by only 1.3% of microbiology labs in 14 African member states being capable of testing for key AMR pathogens [E #5, R #35]. Moreover, AMR impacts food safety, security, livelihoods, and economies, with calls from AU-IBAR leadership to strengthen surveillance, responsible use, and sustainable financing to combat it [E #5, R #23, R #30].\n\nIn addition to AMR, viral outbreaks such as mpox have been declared public health emergencies of continental security, underscoring the vulnerability and challenges in controlling disease transmission. The mpox outbreak features complex transmission dynamics in Central and West Africa, with concerns over vertical transmission, high mortality especially in children under 15, and factors such as low public awareness, limited medical countermeasures, and inadequate response capacities [E #49, DC #2, R #52, R #53]. Such outbreaks highlight the need for improved biosecurity protocols, coordinated cross-border disease surveillance, and compliance with International Health Regulations (2005) to manage movement of people and goods and prevent further spread [R #16, R #37].\n\nTo address these biosafety challenges, African regional institutions such as Africa CDC work closely with global partners including WHO, CEPI, and the African Medicines Agency (AMA) to strengthen health security through enhanced pathogen surveillance, vaccine safety protocols, and emergency preparedness frameworks. Initiatives like the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) build upon Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order to improve surveillance intelligence, emergency supply stockpiling, and rapid deployment of responders [R #41, R #56, R #59]. The establishment of the Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG) by WHO AFRO further provides strategic guidance and independent expertise to reinforce the readiness and resilience of public health systems in the region [E #48, DC #9].\n\nFurthermore, Africa CDC and CEPI's partnership aims to boost vaccine research, development, and manufacturing capabilities to reduce external reliance on medical countermeasures and accelerate outbreak responses, thereby enhancing continent-wide biosafety and health security [DC #10, R #13, R #14]. These efforts are complemented by ongoing regulatory strengthening involving African and European agencies to harmonize approval processes and improve access to quality health products [R #8, R #12, R #25].\n\nOverall, while African countries face significant biosafety challenges including emerging infectious diseases, AMR, and limited infrastructure, concerted continental and international collaborations through Africa CDC and partners are actively working to fortify preparedness, response, and sustainable health system strengthening across the region.\n\n---\n\nReference documents:  \n- antimicrobial-resistance-is-a-greater-threat-than-hiv-aids-tb-and-malaria-says-new-report (DC #5)  \n- mpox-outbreaks-in-africa-constitute-a-public-health-emergency-of-continental-security (DC #2)  \n- forging-resilience-who-afro-establishes-independent-expert-body-bolster-africas-health (DC #9)  \n- africa-cdc-and-cepi-deepen-partnership-to-fortify-african-preparedness-against-disease-outbreaks (DC #10)",

    "return": "# Challenges in AMR Surveillance and Management in African Countries\n\nAfrican countries face several critical challenges in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and management:\n\n1. **High Mortality and Disease Burden**: Africa has the highest mortality rate from AMR, with 27.3 deaths per 100,000 people, surpassing deaths from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. This indicates a severe health impact, especially on vulnerable populations like children [DC #2].\n\n2. **Underfunding**: Despite estimates that USD 2-6 billion annually are needed for effective AMR response, current funding is only about one-tenth of the allocation for other major diseases. This funding gap limits the capacity to address AMR comprehensively and hampers sustainable development efforts [DC #2].\n\n3. **Low Laboratory Capacity**: Only 1.3% of microbiology laboratories in 14 African member states have the capacity to test for key AMR pathogens. This limitation significantly restricts effective surveillance, diagnostic accuracy, and timely intervention [E #11; R #38; DC #2].\n\n4. **Limited Routine Surveillance in Animals**: AMR prevalence in animal farms has been reported in 37 countries, yet only 16% of African countries conduct routine AMR surveillance in animals, affecting the One Health approach needed to control AMR across human, animal, and environmental health [DC #2; E #34].\n\n5. **Drug Misuse and Overuse**: Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in healthcare, agriculture, and food systems accelerate the development of resistance, further complicating management efforts [DC #2].\n\n6. **Fragmented Markets and Weak Demand for Local Products**: There is limited demand for locally produced vaccines and antimicrobials, creating challenges in sustaining local pharmaceutical manufacturing which is crucial for AMR management [DC #5].\n\n7. **Regulatory and Coordination Gaps**: There is need for strengthening regulatory authorities and harmonizing laws like the African Union Model Law to facilitate access to quality medicines and coordinated AMR responses across countries [DC #5].\n\n# Successful Experiences and Strategies\n\nSeveral strategies and positive measures have been identified or implemented to address AMR challenges in Africa:\n\n1. **African Union Landmark Report and Roadmap**: The launch of this report has raised awareness about the severity of AMR and initiated discussions on strategic roadmaps and targets to combat AMR continent-wide [E #3; R #50; DC #2].\n\n2. **Multi-Sectoral Collaboration**: Engaging all levels of society and sectors including healthcare, agriculture, and environment, following a One Health approach, has been emphasized as vital for effective AMR control [E #15; DC #2; R #34].\n\n3. **Strengthening Laboratory Capacity**: Partnerships between Africa CDC and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine focus on improving microbiology laboratory capabilities to test for AMR pathogens and ensure effective surveillance [E #32; R #2, #11, #38; DC #2].\n\n4. **Development of Regulatory Frameworks**: The African Medicines Agency (AMA) and coordination with bodies such as the European Medicines Agency support the strengthening of regulatory processes to ensure access to affordable, quality medicines [E #4, #6; R #9, #12, #32, #35; DC #4].\n\n5. **Sustainable Financing and Resource Mobilization**: Calls for increased funding and sustainable financing mechanisms to support surveillance, diagnostics, treatment, and prevention efforts to address AMR have been highlighted by key leaders [DC #2].\n\n6. **Local Manufacturing Initiatives**: Efforts to strengthen local pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, supported by Africa CDC and European Union collaborations under the Team Europe Initiative (TEI MAV+), aim to improve access to quality antimicrobials and vaccines, contributing indirectly to better AMR management [E #48, #49; R #7, #8, #13; DC #4].\n\n7. **Data-Driven Solutions and Surveillance Expansion**: Promoting routine AMR surveillance in both human and animal health sectors and enhancing data sharing to inform policies and interventions are part of the ongoing strategies supported by various African and international stakeholders [DC #2; E #25].\n\n8. **Leadership and Advocacy**: Leaders like Dr. Raji Tajudeen of Africa CDC and Dr. Huyam Salih of AU-IBAR advocate strongly for coordinated efforts, expanding surveillance, responsible use of antimicrobials, and multi-sectoral engagement [E #5, #53; DC #2].\n\nIn summary, while African countries face significant challenges including limited laboratory capacity, funding gaps, and fragmented regulatory environments in AMR surveillance and management, initiatives such as multi-sectoral collaboration, strengthening laboratory networks, regulatory harmonization, and fostering local pharmaceutical manufacturing provide promising pathways to mitigate the AMR threat on the continent.\n\nFor detailed insights, please refer to the document \"Antimicrobial Resistance is a Greater Threat than HIV-AIDS, TB and Malaria, Says New Report\" and related Africa CDC publications [DC #2, #4, #5].",

    "return": "### Current Biosafety Situation in Africa\n\nAfrica's biosafety situation involves ongoing challenges primarily related to infectious diseases and outbreaks, which pose significant public health risks across the continent. Several infectious diseases, including Mpox (monkeypox), have exhibited prolonged and changing epidemiological patterns marked by high transmissibility, mortality, and considerable social and economic impacts. Since 2022, Mpox outbreaks have surged in various Central and West African countries, triggering a public health emergency of continental security declared by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). These outbreaks pose serious threats to health systems due to limited availability of diagnostics, vaccines, treatments, and other medical countermeasures, further exacerbated by low public awareness and limited understanding of transmission dynamics among populations and some health entities [E #42, E #26, R #26, DC #10].\n\n### Primary Risk Sources\n\nThe main risk sources contributing to biosafety challenges in Africa include:\n\n- Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases like Mpox with evolving transmission dynamics.\n- Cross-border spread due to regional movement of people, animals, and goods, which requires strict adherence to International Health Regulations (2005).\n- Insufficient and uneven access to medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.\n- Limited public awareness and gaps in knowledge on infectious disease transmission.\n- Social and economic disruptions triggered by epidemics that complicate response efforts [E #27, E #39, E #38, R #1, DC #10].\n\n### Infectious Disease Situation\n\nAfrica continues to experience a high burden of infectious disease outbreaks annually, with more than 130 disease outbreaks reported, including Mpox, COVID-19, Ebola, Marburg, and Cholera. The continent faces the challenge of timely detection and response to these outbreaks, necessitating coordinated regional surveillance, laboratory diagnostic capabilities, and rapid emergency response. The ongoing Mpox epidemic specifically highlights the urgency for enhanced preparedness and coordinated actions among African Union Member States and partners [E #41, E #49, R #9, R #27, DC #10].\n\n### Biosafety and Disease Control Capacities\n\nAfrica's biosafety and disease control capabilities are being strengthened through multiple coordinated initiatives led by Africa CDC in partnership with international, regional, and local organizations. Key efforts include:\n\n- Strengthening pathogen surveillance and disease intelligence to enable early detection and risk assessment.\n- Expanding laboratory diagnostic networks and capacities for biomonitoring, biosafety, and biosecurity.\n- Developing workforce skills through joint training, simulation exercises, and cross-border collaboration.\n- Implementing coordinated regional and national response plans adhering to international health standards.\n- Enhancing emergency preparedness, vaccine research and manufacturing capacity, and access to medical countermeasures.\n- Promoting a One Health approach integrating human, animal, and environmental health sectors.\n- Strengthening communication, community engagement, and stigma-free clinical care to support outbreak containment [E #1, E #6, E #14, E #16, R #4, R #13, DC #10].\n\nAfrica CDC also collaborates closely with partners such as WHO, UNICEF, and the European Commission’s Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority to support infrastructure, surveillance, and rapid deployment of resources during health emergencies across diverse regions—including Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Africa—ensuring a continent-wide biosafety strengthening framework [R #2, R #12, R #54, R #56, R #61].\n\nIn summary, while Africa continues to face significant biosafety risks from ongoing and emerging infectious diseases with considerable impact on public health and socioeconomics, robust multisectoral and multi-agency efforts under Africa CDC’s leadership are progressively enhancing the continent’s capacity for timely surveillance, diagnostics, preparedness, and effective outbreak response.\n\nThis overview is based on the detailed information from:\n- \"Communiqué: United in the Fight Against Mpox in Africa – High-Level Emergency Regional Meeting\" [DC #10]\n- \"Africa CDC and CEPI deepen partnership to fortify African preparedness against disease outbreaks\" [DC #1]\n- \"Antimicrobial Resistance Is a Greater Threat Than HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, Says New Report\" [E #46]\n- Related relationships and descriptions about Africa CDC's coordination roles and partnerships [R #1, R #4, R #9, R #13]",

    "return": "### Africa's Current Biosafety Situation\n\nAfrica faces a complex biosafety landscape marked by frequent health emergencies and significant threats arising from infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The continent experiences over 100 health emergencies annually, which disrupt economies, weaken fragile health systems, and affect the well-being of millions [DC #2][R #20]. Biosafety threats are compounded by factors such as climate change and conflict, which aggravate more than half of these health emergencies, increasing vulnerability and complicating emergency preparedness and response [DC #2][R #14][R #16].\n\n### Major Biosafety Threats\n\n1. **Mpox (Monkeypox):**  \n   Mpox is a viral infectious disease endemic primarily in Central and West Africa. It is highly transmissible, with notable mortality rates and significant social and economic impacts. The recent increase in case numbers and deaths emphasizes its role as a major public health risk in Africa. Mpox outbreaks have been designated by Africa CDC as a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS), due to its severity and risk to continental and global health security [E #55][R #17][R #18][R #58].\n\n2. **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):**  \n   AMR poses a critical biosafety threat in Africa, surpassing mortality from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. It affects not only health directly but also impacts food safety, security, livelihoods, and economies, particularly threatening children and vulnerable populations. Surveillance and response activities against AMR are ongoing across all major African regions including Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Africa [E #41][R #1][R #29][R #35].\n\n### Risk Sources and Transmission\n\n- **Cross-border Movement:**  \n  The movement of people, animals, and goods across national borders facilitates the spread of infectious threats such as mpox, creating challenges for containment and surveillance efforts. These movements require strict monitoring in line with International Health Regulations (2005) to prevent broader dissemination [R #19][R #39][R #71].\n\n- **Climate Change and Conflict:**  \n  Environmental changes and socio-political instability exacerbate health emergencies, reducing resilience and increasing disease outbreak frequency. They also hinder rapid response capabilities and strain health infrastructure [R #14][R #16][R #54].\n\n- **Limited Availability of Medical Countermeasures:**  \n  There is a scarcity of vaccines and therapeutics for diseases like mpox, which impacts outbreak control and increases risks of severe disease outcomes [E #55].\n\n### Impact\n\nThese biosafety threats have significant economic and social consequences, disrupting livelihoods and increasing public concern. They influence health emergency declarations and prioritize continental response coordination. Specifically, mpox outbreaks have prompted continent-wide emergency measures to mitigate spread and impact, with a focus on strengthening surveillance, capacity building, laboratory networks, and coordinated responses through mechanisms like the Africa Taskforce for Mpox Coordination [R #73][R #72].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfrica's biosafety situation is complicated by multiple concurrent health threats including infectious diseases such as mpox and pervasive antimicrobial resistance, both necessitating strengthened emergency preparedness, surveillance, and response capabilities. Collaborative efforts led by Africa CDC, WHO AFRO, and partners emphasize strategic guidance, capacity building, and regional coordination to address these risks effectively and protect public health across the continent [DC #2][R #5][R #20].\n\nReferences for detailed information are found in the following documents:  \n- \"Forging Resilience: WHO AFRO Establishes Independent Expert Body to Bolster Africa's Health Security\" [DC #2]  \n- \"mpox-outbreaks-in-africa-constitute-a-public-health-emergency-of-continental-security\" [E #17, E #55]  \n- \"antimicrobial-resistance-is-a-greater-threat-than-hiv-aids-tb-and-malaria-says-new-report\" [E #41]  \n- \"communique-united-in-the-fight-against-mpox-in-africa-high-level-emergency-regional-meeting\" [E #38]",

    "return": "### Challenges Faced by African Countries and Regions in Addressing Cross-border Biosafety Risks and Infectious Disease Transmission\n\nAfrican countries and regions face several specific challenges in managing cross-border biosafety risks, particularly concerning the transmission of infectious diseases. These challenges include:\n\n1. **High Cross-border Movement**  \n   The frequent population movement across national borders facilitates the spread of infectious diseases like mpox, complicating containment efforts. Such mobility increases the risk of disease transmission to neighboring countries, demanding robust cross-border collaboration which is often insufficiently coordinated [E/R #21, 56].\n\n2. **Limited Understanding of Disease Transmission**  \n   There is limited and insufficient knowledge regarding transmission modes of diseases such as mpox among the public and some health entities. This lack of understanding hinders effective outbreak control and public health interventions [E #36].\n\n3. **Insufficient Cross-border Collaboration and Coordination**  \n   Although mechanisms and commitments exist to strengthen cross-border cooperation—including data sharing, joint planning, and resource sharing—implementation gaps remain. Stronger multi-sectoral and inclusive coordination between affected and at-risk countries is necessary to effectively respond to outbreaks [E/R #6, 32, 36].\n\n4. **Challenges in Surveillance and Rapid Response Capacities**  \n   Delays and limitations in disease surveillance, laboratory diagnostic capabilities, and rapid deployment of public health experts across borders further impede timely detection and response to outbreaks. Capacity building including joint training and simulation exercises are critical but not uniformly achieved [E/R #2, 6].\n\n5. **Limited Access to Medical Countermeasures and Health Technologies**  \n   Shortages or limited availability of vaccines, diagnostics, and treatment options constrain outbreak management. Regulatory and logistical hurdles, particularly for rapid cross-border assignment of medical personnel and supplies, exacerbate this limitation [E/R #8].\n\n6. **Socio-political and Economic Factors**  \n   The economic and social impacts of outbreaks generate public concern and can lead to political and logistical challenges in enacting coordinated response measures. Resource constraints and competing priorities in different countries affect harmonized action [E #32].\n\n7. **Compliance with International Health Regulations**  \n   Ensuring that all countries monitor and report outbreaks according to the International Health Regulations (2005) remains challenging. Proper implementation of these regulations is vital for coordinated, rapid information exchange and effective biosafety management across borders [E/R #39].\n\n### Root Causes of These Challenges\n\n- **Structural and Capacity Limitations**  \n  Many African countries have under-resourced health systems and gaps in laboratory and surveillance infrastructure necessary for effective outbreak detection and response within and across borders [E/R #7, 57].\n\n- **Complexity of Multi-sectoral Coordination**  \n  Disease control requires involvement of multiple sectors and international partners, including governments, health ministries, and organizations (e.g., Africa CDC, WHO, UNICEF). Aligning strategies and actions across diverse actors is complicated and remains a work in progress [E/R #2, 6, 46].\n\n- **Socioeconomic and Mobility Patterns**  \n  High levels of cross-border trade, migration, and informal movement increase transmission risks and complicate coordinated control efforts [E/R #56].\n\n- **Knowledge and Research Gaps**  \n  Limited research on disease epidemiology and transmission in African settings constrains evidence-based policymaking and response design [E/R #35].\n\nOverall, these challenges highlight the need for strengthened regional collaboration, improved health system capacity, enhanced surveillance, and harmonized cross-border response mechanisms to effectively manage biosafety risks and infectious disease transmission in Africa.\n\nThis synthesis is based on detailed insights from the \"Communiqué: United in the Fight Against Mpox in Africa – High-Level Emergency Regional Meeting,\" the \"Mpox outbreaks in Africa constitute a public health emergency of continental security\" report, and related Africa CDC documentation [DC #2, 8, 9; E/R #6, 21, 32, 36, 39].",

    "return": "# Current Biosafety Situation in Africa\n\nThe overall biosafety situation in Africa is characterized by persistent challenges related to infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and frequent health emergencies triggered by outbreaks, conflicts, and climate change. Africa faces a high burden of infectious diseases and continues to experience numerous public health emergencies annually, including over 100 disease outbreaks each year. These emergencies necessitate robust biosafety and biosecurity measures across the continent [E #32; DC #8].\n\n## Infectious Disease Threats and Emergency Preparedness\n\nInfectious diseases such as Mpox (monkeypox) remain endemic in multiple African countries, particularly in Central and West Africa, with ongoing epidemics causing significant health and socio-economic impacts. The severity and sustained transmission of such diseases have led the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) to declare Mpox a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS) in August 2024. This underscores the critical biosafety risk posed by infectious agents and highlights the continent-wide coordinated response required [E #24, #25, #29; R #19, #23].\n\nAfrica CDC has partnered with various organizations including WHO and UNICEF, and has launched strategic initiatives such as the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to enhance emergency preparedness and response efforts. JEAP aims to strengthen surveillance, genomic sequencing, rapid deployment of responders, supply chain management, and cross-border collaboration to manage and contain outbreaks efficiently, thereby reinforcing biosafety infrastructure and capabilities [E #5, #6, #33; R #9, #10, #25].\n\n## Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\n\nA significant biosafety concern in Africa is antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which has become a greater threat than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined, according to recent reports by Africa CDC. AMR affects healthcare, food safety, security, and agriculture, undermining treatment efficacy and contributing to increased mortality. It disproportionately affects children and vulnerable populations. Addressing AMR is central to Africa CDC’s health security agenda and is integrated into continental strategies and surveillance activities across all African regions [E #8, #34, #43; R #3, #26, #28, #32].\n\nEfforts to combat AMR involve multi-sectoral collaboration, including the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), which focuses on related threats to agrifood systems. Coordination extends to informing global platforms such as the United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting to galvanize international action against AMR [E #44; R #18, #35, #36].\n\n## Strengthening Biosafety Through Partnerships and Strategic Initiatives\n\nAfrica CDC emphasizes building local capacities for biosafety and biosecurity through partnerships with global and regional organizations. For example, collaborations with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) focus on enhancing vaccine safety protocols, pathogen surveillance, and biosecurity measures to ensure effective and safe deployment of vaccines and diagnostics [R #21, #22].\n\nThe African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), supported by Africa CDC, aims to boost local vaccine production to meet 60% of Africa's demand by 2040, thereby enhancing regional biosafety through improved vaccine availability and supply chain resilience [E #38, #39; R #30].\n\nFurthermore, Africa CDC spearheads health security frameworks aligned with African Union Agenda 2063, emphasizing sustainable health system strengthening, equitable access to medical products, and regulatory harmonization to uphold biosafety standards [E #42; R #16, #39].\n\n## Regional Focus\n\nBiosafety efforts and emergency response activities cover all African subregions—Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Africa—addressing region-specific challenges and disease burdens. Notably, regions such as Eastern Africa are focal points for visceral leishmaniasis elimination and pathogen genomic surveillance, while Central and Western Africa remain critical for Mpox control and AMR surveillance [E #7, #9, #11, #12; R #2, #4, #6, #7].\n\n---\n\nOverall, Africa’s biosafety landscape is shaped by ongoing infectious disease threats, the emergent challenge of AMR, and a strengthening network of continental partnerships and initiatives led by Africa CDC and supported by WHO and other global partners. These efforts collectively aim to improve surveillance, rapid response, local manufacturing, and comprehensive health security to better manage and mitigate biohazards across the continent.\n\n[DC #8, #7, #9; E #5, #8, #24, #25, #34, #38, #42; R #3, #9, #10, #19, #23, #25, #30, #32, #39]",

    "return": "## Overview of Biosafety Characteristics and Differences Across Major African Regions\n\nBiosafety in Africa involves the implementation of safety protocols, surveillance, and response measures to protect public health from infectious diseases and outbreaks. Various regions in Africa exhibit differences in their biosafety capacities and challenges, influenced by factors such as disease burden, healthcare infrastructure, regional prioritization, and collaborative initiatives.\n\n### Regional Burden and Focus Areas\n\n- **Eastern Africa**: This region is highly significant for pathogen genomic activities and is a focal area for public health initiatives addressing outbreaks such as mpox and visceral leishmaniasis, which accounts for 73% of global cases in 2022. Eastern Africa benefits from coordinated health emergency initiatives and conducts active surveillance and genomic sequencing to support biosafety and outbreak preparedness.\n\n- **Central Africa**: Central Africa participates actively in Mpox surveillance and research and is a key region for pathogen genomic surveillance. The region is supported through partnerships and initiatives to strengthen diagnostics, surveillance, and emergency response systems. The involvement of France and regional health projects is noted in enhancing biosafety measures.\n\n- **Northern Africa**: While not elaborated extensively, Northern Africa is included among regions focused on antimicrobial resistance surveillance and pathogen genomics, indicating ongoing efforts toward strengthening biosafety capacities.\n\n- **Southern Africa**: Southern Africa is involved in Africa CDC's health diagnostics decentralization and outbreak response initiatives. It plays a significant role in pathogen genomic activities and epidemic response, contributing to the regional biosafety landscape.\n\n- **Western Africa**: Western Africa faces challenges associated with mpox and antimicrobial resistance and is actively involved in health emergency preparedness and outbreak response. The region participates in genomic surveillance efforts, underscoring its role in biosafety.\n\n### Key Differences and Challenges\n\n- **Laboratory Capacity for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)**: Across Africa, microbiology laboratory capacity varies significantly. Only about 1.3% of microbiology laboratories in 14 member states are capable of testing key AMR pathogens seriously limiting effective biosafety surveillance. Improvements vary by region, with some regions advancing genomic surveillance and others still developing basic laboratory infrastructures.\n\n- **Disease Prevalence and Impact**: Regions like Eastern Africa, heavily burdened with diseases such as visceral leishmaniasis, exhibit a heightened need for targeted biosafety frameworks. Similarly, AMR poses a significant threat continent-wide but with variable surveillance and reporting capacities among regions.\n\n- **Collaborative and Capacity Building Initiatives**: There is a continent-wide effort coordinated by Africa CDC and partners to improve vaccine R&D, clinical trial infrastructure, pathogen surveillance, and rapid outbreak response capabilities. However, the implementation and maturity of these initiatives differ across regions due to varying resource availability, infrastructure, and political commitment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Africa as a whole faces considerable biosafety challenges due to high disease burdens and infrastructural disparities, regions show distinct profiles shaped by disease prevalence and the sophistication of health systems. Eastern and Southern Africa demonstrate advanced engagement in genomic and pathogen surveillance. Central Africa is a hub for surveillance and research partnerships, whereas Western and Northern Africa are increasingly focusing on surveillance and response. Enhancing laboratory capacities, harmonizing regulatory processes, and strengthening regional collaborations are pivotal to improving biosafety across all African regions.\n\n[DC #1, #4, #6; E #9, #24, #38, #44, #45; R #2, #4, #6, #7, #18, #28, #30, #31, #32, #33]",

    "return": "### Biosecurity Risk Areas in Africa\n\nAfrica faces significant biosecurity risks that are multidimensional and span various fields, locations, and sectors. Key biosecurity risk points include infectious disease outbreaks such as mpox (monkeypox), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and challenges related to local manufacturing of vaccines and health products. These risks stem from the continent's high burden of infectious diseases, emerging outbreaks, limited local health infrastructure, and regulatory challenges.\n\n### Regional Differences and Their Causes\n\n1. **Eastern Africa**  \n   - **Risk Points:** High prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and focus on mpox outbreaks. It is a region heavily targeted for AMR surveillance, disease intelligence, and pathogen genomics activities.  \n   - **Causes:** The disease burden with 73% of global VL cases in 2022 and its role as a hub for advanced genomic surveillance contribute to heightened biosecurity risks. The region also hosts multiple health emergency response activities coordinated by Africa CDC and partners.  \n   ([E #13]; [R #1, 27, 23])\n\n2. **Central Africa**  \n   - **Risk Points:** Endemic mpox region with ongoing outbreaks; also a focus for pathogen surveillance and health system strengthening efforts.  \n   - **Causes:** The occurrence of repeated mpox epidemics and strategic role in regional disease surveillance heighten its biosecurity risks. Support from partners like France indicates the international engagement required for biosecurity management here.  \n   ([E #15]; [R #3])\n\n3. **Western Africa**  \n   - **Risk Points:** Mpox endemic countries, active in antimicrobial resistance surveillance and outbreak response initiatives.  \n   - **Causes:** The burden of infectious diseases like mpox and AMR, combined with participation in continental health security programs, positions this region as critical for biosecurity vigilance.  \n   ([E #16]; [R #5, 31, 25])\n\n4. **Southern Africa**  \n   - **Risk Points:** Participation in outbreak and epidemic response, genomic surveillance, and health emergency preparedness.  \n   - **Causes:** The region’s involvement in coordinated health emergency and pathogen genomic activities derives from its role in continental response frameworks.  \n   ([E #17]; [R #6])\n\n5. **Northern Africa**  \n   - **Risk Points:** Mpox preparedness, AMR monitoring, disaster and crisis management.  \n   - **Causes:** Its strategic position in managing health emergencies and participation in AU-EU health partnerships amplify its biosecurity concerns.  \n   ([E #18]; [R #7])\n\n### Cross-Cutting Risk Drivers\n\n- **Infectious Diseases and Outbreaks:** Mpox outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance represent major public health threats driving biosecurity risks across regions. Mpox has significant social, economic, and health impacts, including risks to vulnerable groups such as children and people with HIV ([E #30, #31, #36]); AMR disproportionately affects vulnerable populations and threatens food safety and livelihoods ([E #14, #46, #48]; [R #2, 36, 37]).\n  \n- **Healthcare Infrastructure and Regulatory Challenges:** Inadequate and fragmented regulatory systems delay access to safe medicines and vaccines, impacting biosecurity by limiting rapid response capacity and local manufacturing. Efforts to harmonize regulatory processes through bodies like the African Medicines Agency (AMA) and collaborations with WHO and European Medicines Agency (EMA) aim to reduce these risks ([E #23, #25]; [R #15, 18, 34]).\n\n- **Genomic Surveillance and Diagnostics:** Enhanced pathogen surveillance and genomic initiatives led by Africa CDC support early detection and control of emerging threats, thereby mitigating biosecurity risks ([E #32]; [R #20, 23, 25]).\n\n- **Global Health Partnerships:** Collaborations with global partners including WHO, CEPI, EU, and the U.S. government facilitate improved emergency preparedness, health system strengthening, vaccine development, and outbreak response ([E #12]; [R #8, 13, 19, 21, 29]).\n\n### Summary\n\nThe biosecurity risk landscape in Africa varies by region, shaped by the local epidemiology of diseases, health system capacity, and regulatory environment. Central and West Africa face substantial risks from mpox due to endemicity, while Eastern Africa bears a heavy burden of visceral leishmaniasis and AMR. All regions are engaged in increasing genomic surveillance and outbreak response activities coordinated by Africa CDC and partners. Systemic challenges, including slow regulatory approvals and insufficient local manufacturing capacity, also contribute to ongoing biosecurity vulnerabilities. These efforts and partnerships across sectors and regions aim to build a more resilient public health infrastructure and strengthen biosecurity across Africa.\n\n[Sources: DC #1, #5, #6; E #12, #13, #15, #16, #17, #18, #30, #36, #48; R #1, #2, #3, #5, #6, #7, #8, #13, #15, #18, #19, #20, #21, #23, #25, #27, #29, #31, #34, #36, #37]",

    "return": "### Current State of Biosafety in Africa\n\nAfrica Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is actively engaged in strengthening the continent’s health emergency preparedness and response capacity, which encompasses biosafety concerns as part of its broader mandate to improve disease surveillance, outbreak response, and emergency preparedness across all African regions including Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Africa. These efforts are typically coordinated through strategic partnerships with organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), public and private health institutions, and regional health initiatives. Africa CDC’s role includes mobilizing resources, building health system resilience, and advancing diagnostic capabilities, which are all crucial components for effective biosafety management [E #2, #26; R #1, #3, #6, #7, #8; DC #3].\n\nThe continent faces frequent disease outbreaks annually, with over 100 reported events, many requiring rapid emergency response and preparedness measures that inherently involve biosafety protocols. Africa CDC and WHO in 2023 launched the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP), a five-year strategic collaboration that includes priorities such as strengthening surveillance intelligence, expanding genomic sequencing capabilities for quicker pathogen detection, stockpiling essential supplies at sub-regional hubs, and rapid deployment of responders within 24-48 hours. This initiative addresses biosafety by improving laboratory capacities and outbreak control measures across multiple African regions, directly contributing to safer management of infectious agents [DC #8; R #10].\n\nAdditionally, Africa CDC places a strong emphasis on advancing molecular diagnostics and genomic surveillance through its Institute for Pathogen Genomics, enhancing the continent’s ability to detect and respond to pathogens safely and efficiently. The expansion of these capabilities supports biosafety by enabling early identification and containment of infectious diseases and biohazards across the diverse regional contexts of Africa [E #7; R #5].\n\nFurthermore, coordinated efforts like the Saving Lives and Livelihoods (SLL) initiative, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, focus on strengthening public health systems, including workforce training, healthcare infrastructure, and vaccination campaigns. Strengthening health systems through such initiatives enhances biosafety by improving infection control practices and ensuring preparedness for health emergencies [DC #5; R #9].\n\nRegulatory and manufacturing challenges are also being addressed to boost local production of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics with strict adherence to vaccine safety protocols and regulatory harmonization across African nations. Africa CDC supports regulatory capacity building, including efforts to streamline WHO prequalification processes, which are critical to ensuring that locally manufactured health products meet global safety standards, thereby reinforcing biosafety [DC #9; R #26].\n\nIn conclusion, the overall biosafety situation in Africa is improving through coordinated continental strategies led by Africa CDC and partners, emphasizing enhanced surveillance, rapid response, genomics-based monitoring, workforce capacity building, and regulatory strengthening. However, these efforts are part of ongoing developments aimed at transforming Africa’s health security landscape to better manage biosafety threats in the future [E #2, #26; DC #8, #9; R #10, #26].",

    "return": "# Challenges in Biosafety Across Major African Countries and Regions\n\nAfrica faces significant challenges in biosafety largely due to its high burden of infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and frequent health emergencies exacerbated by factors such as conflict and climate change. The continent experiences over 100 health emergencies annually, highlighting the pressing need for robust public health preparedness and response systems [DC #2; E #2].\n\n## Common Biosafety Challenges\n\n- **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):** AMR poses a grave threat across Africa, resulting in higher mortality rates than HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. There is widespread inappropriate use of antimicrobials in healthcare, agriculture, and food systems, which accelerates resistance development. Poor laboratory capacity is a critical limitation; only about 1.3% of microbiology laboratories in 14 member states can test for key AMR pathogens, constraining effective surveillance and response [DC #6, #7; E #12, #13, #33, #38; R #10, #12, #34].\n\n- **Limited Laboratory and Diagnostic Capacity:** Many African countries struggle with insufficient diagnostic infrastructure to support genomic surveillance and pathogen identification. Although initiatives like the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative and the Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative have expanded genomic testing laboratories continent-wide, gaps remain, especially at local levels [DC #1, #10; E #8, #17, #37; R #60].\n\n- **Low Public Awareness:** Especially concerning diseases like mpox, low public awareness hampers disease containment and biosafety efforts [E #14; R #66].\n\n- **Frequent Emergencies and Conflicts:** Climate change and conflict aggravate health crises, complicating biosafety management and emergency preparedness, as supported by the Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group's efforts [DC #2; E #31; R #64].\n\n## Regional and Country-Specific Differences\n\n- **Eastern Africa:** This region bears a heavy disease burden including 73% of global visceral leishmaniasis cases and is a key focus for elimination efforts. It hosts expanded genomic surveillance activities and active emergency response programs [E #5; R #20, #26, #42].\n\n- **Central Africa:** Central Africa is heavily involved in pathogen genomic activities and mpox surveillance. It benefits from regional support projects led by France and is targeted by various public health initiatives [E #24; R #22, #28, #76, #43].\n\n- **Northern Africa:** Northern Africa faces challenges related to mpox preparedness, antimicrobial resistance surveillance, and is within strategic health security frameworks emphasizing strengthening diagnostics and outbreak responses [E #4; R #33, #44, #54].\n\n- **Southern Africa:** This region is actively engaged in mpox outbreak management, genomic surveillance, and health emergency initiatives, forming part of continent-wide collaboration strategies [E #9; R #23, #31, #45, #55].\n\n- **Western Africa:** Western Africa experiences mpox outbreaks and undertakes AMR surveillance activities. It is integrated within broad public health and emergency preparedness strategies including those with African Union-European Union cooperation [E #22; R #32, #46, #56].\n\n- **Country Example - Botswana:** Botswana is highlighted as one of the initial five African Union Member States to receive cold chain equipment to improve vaccine storage and immunization, indicating targeted biosafety strengthening efforts at the national level [E #19; R #47, #57].\n\n## Summary\n\nWhile biosafety challenges such as antimicrobial resistance, limited diagnostic capacity, and frequent emergencies are shared across Africa, regional disparities exist in disease burdens, surveillance capacities, and public health responses. Eastern Africa confronts visceral leishmaniasis, Central Africa focuses on mpox and genomic activities with international support, Northern and Southern Africa are involved heavily in mpox preparedness and AMR surveillance, and Western Africa participates actively in multi-level health security initiatives. Tailored strategies that consider these regional differences are critical for effective biosafety management in Africa.\n\n[DC #1, #2, #6, #7, #10; E #2, #4, #5, #9, #12, #13, #14, #19, #22, #24, #33, #38; R #10, #12, #20, #26, #28, #31, #32, #33, #34, #43, #44, #46, #47, #54, #57, #60, #76]",

    "return": "# Impact of Biosafety Risks in Africa on Public Health Systems, Economic Development, Social Stability, and Regional Security\n\nBiosafety risks in Africa, including the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and infectious disease outbreaks such as mpox, have significant and multifaceted impacts spanning public health systems, economic development, social stability, and regional security.\n\n## Effects on Public Health Systems\n\nBiosafety risks profoundly challenge the capacity and resilience of public health systems across Africa. These risks strain health infrastructure and workforce, hinder disease surveillance and response capabilities, and amplify vulnerabilities revealed by crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Antimicrobial resistance, in particular, compromises treatment effectiveness, leading to higher mortality and complicated disease management. Vulnerable groups, including children, are disproportionately affected, further burdening healthcare resources and demanding strengthened health workforce investment for effective health security[DC #7; E #34, #40, #44; R #31, #36]. \n\nEfforts like those from Africa CDC and partnerships with organizations such as WHO, UNICEF, and CEPI underscore the need to enhance surveillance intelligence, genomic sequencing, and emergency preparedness to mitigate biosafety threats[DC #7, #8; E #2, #11; R #5, #13, #22]. Moreover, initiatives such as the Saving Lives and Livelihoods (SLL) aim to build robust health institutions and vaccination programs to reinforce public health capacities[DC #5; E #37; R #30].\n\n## Economic Development Impacts\n\nBiosafety risks undermine economic stability through direct and indirect channels. The compromised health of populations leads to decreased productivity, increased healthcare expenditures, and strained social services. Economic and social disruptions caused by mpox outbreaks exemplify how disease outbreaks can affect livelihoods, public concern, and economic activities. Additionally, antimicrobial resistance threatens food safety, agricultural productivity, and livelihoods, with broader economic implications for agrifood systems and economies[DC #6; E #34, #40, #45; R #24, #29, #31, #33, #37].\n\nThe need for sustainable financing and investment in health is critical to counteract these economic challenges and ensure that health emergencies do not hinder progress toward developmental goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and African Union Agenda 2063[DC #4; E #38, #41; R #31, #33].\n\n## Social Stability Consequences\n\nBiosafety threats affect social stability by escalating public health risks and creating uncertainty within communities. High mortality rates, treatment failures, and the burden of diseases like mpox lead to heightened public concern and a need for coordinated cross-border responses to prevent epidemic spread. Disruption of health services and economic hardship disproportionately impact vulnerable populations, potentially exacerbating inequalities and social tensions[DC #6; E #27, #28, #44; R #24, #25, #36].\n\nThe multi-sectoral nature of biosafety challenges, involving health, agriculture, and food security sectors, demands integrated actions to sustain social cohesion and resilience against health emergencies.\n\n## Regional Security Implications\n\nFrom a regional security perspective, biosafety risks pose threats to continental stability and governance. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared outbreaks such as mpox a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS), highlighting the severe potential for health crises to undermine regional security. The risk of pathogen spread beyond borders, coupled with social and economic disruptions, necessitates rapid and coordinated continental responses exemplified by initiatives such as the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP)[DC #8; E #2, #18, #20; R #16, #17, #23, #26].\n\nStrengthening local manufacturing capacity for vaccines and therapeutics, enhancing regulatory frameworks, and fostering strategic partnerships are integral to building health sovereignty and mitigating biosafety risks threatening regional security and public health systems[DC #9; E #12, #49; R #10, #11, #40].\n\n---\n\nIn summary, biosafety risks in Africa impose profound and interconnected challenges that undermine public health systems' effectiveness, disrupt economic development, threaten social stability, and challenge regional security frameworks. These impacts emphasize the critical importance of integrated, multi-sectoral strategies and sustained investments in health security and emergency preparedness to safeguard Africa's future[DC #7, #8, #9; E #34, #40, #41; R #5, #16, #24, #31].",

    "return": "### China’s Strategic Interests in Africa\n\nBased on the provided knowledge base, there is no explicit information detailing China's strategic interests in Africa. The documents and knowledge graph predominantly focus on African public health initiatives, partnerships involving Africa CDC, the European Union, United States, and other organizations in health security, disease outbreaks, vaccine production, antimicrobial resistance, and emergency preparedness. No references discuss China’s strategic domains or interests on the continent.\n\n### Biological Security Risks and Their Characteristics in Africa\n\nThe African continent faces several significant biosafety and biosecurity risks mainly associated with infectious disease outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance. Key risks include:\n\n- **Mpox Outbreaks**: Mpox (monkeypox) outbreaks have been declared a public health emergency of continental security by Africa CDC due to high case numbers, mortality, changing transmission dynamics, and potential for spread beyond Africa. Such outbreaks involve severe infection risks, especially in vulnerable populations like children and people living with HIV. The outbreaks are also characterized by challenges including limited vaccine availability, poor detection rates, and cross-border transmission risks, demanding coordinated response and surveillance efforts [DC #4; R #54, 56].\n\n- **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)**: AMR poses a critical health threat across African regions, linked not only to challenges in treating infections but also affecting food security, livelihoods, and economies. Resistance undermines clinical treatment efficacy, raising mortality and heightening public health risks continent-wide. The threat spans all African regions and demands enhanced laboratory capacity, integrated surveillance, and multisectoral collaboration as emphasized by African Union bodies and public health organizations [DC #10; R #35, 38, 49, 66, 68].\n\n- **Pandemic and Emerging Infectious Diseases**: The possibility of new pandemics is recognized as imminent in Africa, urging improvements in emergency preparedness and response capabilities. Strengthened partnerships, health system resilience, and multi-sectoral approaches such as One Health are prioritized to manage interconnected health risks involving humans, animals, and environment [R #3, 53, 70].\n\n- **Health Security and Regulatory Challenges**: Efforts focus on building resilient health systems, harmonizing regulatory frameworks (including through the African Medicines Agency), and enhancing access to vaccines and medical countermeasures. These actions address gaps in surveillance, diagnostics decentralization, and outbreak rapid response, all vital for biosecurity [R #16, 37, 77].\n\n### Characteristics of These Biological Security Risks\n\n- **Transboundary and Regional**: Diseases like mpox and AMR resistant pathogens cross borders and affect multiple African regions (Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, Western Africa), requiring coordinated regional and continental actions [R #2, 17, 27, 28, 29, 33, 35, 38].\n\n- **Multisectoral Impact**: Risks affect not only health but also economic activities, food systems, and social structures. Stakeholders from governments, international organizations, private sectors, and communities are engaged to tackle these challenges [DC #5; R #39, 40, 67].\n\n- **Complex Transmission Dynamics**: For instance, mpox transmission has evolved regionally with demonstrated heterogeneity in affected populations, posing novel challenges like vertical transmission risks and asymptomatic infections [DC #4].\n\n- **Emerging and Recurrent Threats**: The biosafety risks are ongoing with trends of increasing cases and mortality (e.g., mpox), alongside rising AMR that threatens to undermine decades of medical progress [DC #4; R #49].\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile the knowledge base does not specify China’s particular strategic interests in Africa, it extensively documents critical biological and public health security risks in Africa marked by regional outbreaks of diseases like mpox, escalating antimicrobial resistance, and overarching pandemic threats. These risks are characterized by their cross-border nature, multifaceted impact, evolving epidemiology, and the need for comprehensive, collaborative response strategies.\n\n[DC #4, #5, #10; R #3, 35, 38, 39, 49, 54, 56, 66, 68, 70, 77]",

    "return": "### Roles of Africa CDC and WHO in Biosafety Collaboration in Africa\n\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) serves as a continental public health agency of the African Union, dedicated to strengthening health institutions, capacities, and health security across Africa. It plays a core role in disease surveillance, outbreak response, and emergency preparedness to detect, prevent, control, and manage health threats throughout the continent. Africa CDC collaborates closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) at various levels—from headquarters to regional centers and country offices—to coordinate regional responses, including technical support and capacity building. Through strategic partnerships, such as the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP), Africa CDC and WHO aim to enhance health systems, improve emergency preparedness, and combat disease outbreaks including mpox and other infectious diseases [E #1, #2, #3; R #1, #54].\n\n### Specific Achievements in Epidemic Surveillance, Emergency Response, and Vaccine Production\n\n1. **Epidemic Surveillance and Response:**\n   - Africa CDC leads continent-wide surveillance initiatives and epidemic response coordination, including cross-border collaboration among member states, to rapidly detect and contain infectious diseases.\n   - Africa CDC and WHO’s JEAP partnership focuses on improving genomic surveillance and strengthening emergency response capabilities by deploying first responders quickly and stockpiling emergency supplies in strategic hubs to reduce delivery times drastically.\n   - Africa CDC has supported the establishment of pathogen genomic institutes and launched several molecular diagnostic initiatives to enhance outbreak detection accuracy and timeliness.\n   - The agency collaborates with multiple regional and international partners such as UNICEF, US CDC, USAID, CEPI, and the African Public Health Foundation to strengthen public health systems and emergency preparedness [E #3, #11, #15; R #1, #6, #9, #12, #13, #16, #22, #59].\n\n2. **Local Vaccine Manufacturing and Access:**\n   - Africa CDC is spearheading vaccine manufacturing initiatives with a goal to locally produce 60% of Africa's vaccines by 2040, contributing to health sovereignty and resilience.\n   - The launch of the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA) exemplifies this effort, with Africa CDC collaborating with partners and governments to expand manufacturing capacity.\n   - Africa CDC and CEPI have formed a strategic partnership focusing on vaccine research, development, sustainable manufacturing, and safety protocols to ensure rapid mobilization of vaccine production during outbreaks.\n   - Regional collaborations with the European Union and African Medicines Agency have aimed at overcoming regulatory challenges and supporting manufacturers' access to international procurement systems.\n   - Initiatives such as the Saving Lives and Livelihoods partnership, supported by Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation, aim to improve vaccine equity by procuring vaccines and enhancing cold chain infrastructure across Africa [E #1, #3, #19, #36, #46; R #5, #24, #27, #31, #33, #39, #48].\n\n### Recommendations for China to Deepen Biosafety Cooperation\n\nChina can learn from Africa CDC and WHO's collaborative model by emphasizing coordinated multilevel partnerships that combine regional leadership, technical expertise, and international support to build resilient health systems. Key recommendations include:\n\n1. **Strengthen Regional Coordination and Surveillance Systems:**\n   - Establish integrated pathogen surveillance frameworks and genomic sequencing capacities tailored to local epidemiological contexts.\n   - Promote data sharing and cross-border collaboration to enhance early detection and response effectiveness.\n\n2. **Invest in Local Manufacturing Capacity:**\n   - Support development of local vaccine and diagnostic manufacturing ecosystems, facilitated by clear regulatory pathways and technology transfers.\n   - Align manufacturing efforts with international quality standards such as WHO prequalification to enable broader market access.\n\n3. **Develop Strategic Partnerships:**\n   - Foster government-to-government and multilateral collaborations involving WHO, Africa CDC-like centers, and other stakeholders to leverage resources and knowledge exchange.\n   - Promote joint emergency preparedness plans modeled after JEAP to synchronize responses across regions during epidemics and health emergencies.\n\n4. **Enhance Capacity Building and Workforce Development:**\n   - Prioritize training and retaining skilled health workers, laboratory technicians, and epidemiologists, learning from Africa CDC’s strategic workforce initiatives.\n   - Support institutional strengthening of public health agencies to prepare for complex health threats.\n\nBy adopting a holistic, partnership-based approach focused on surveillance, rapid response, and sustainable manufacturing, China can improve both its own biosafety resilience and contribute meaningfully to health security in Africa and globally [DC #6, #7, #8, #10; E #1, #3; R #1, #54].\n\n---\n\nThis summary reflects information drawn directly from the provided documents \"Africa CDC and WHO Launch Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to Strengthen Health Systems and Combat Disease Outbreaks in Africa,\" \"Partnership for Public Health Emergencies Preparedness & Response Seeks 1 Billion USD | Africa CDC and WHO Strengthen Efforts to Safeguard Africa’s Health,\" \"Addressing Regulatory Challenges to Advance Local Manufacturing in Africa,\" and other Africa CDC resources.",

    "return": "### Impact of Local Vaccine and Diagnostic Production on Africa’s Biosafety\n\nLocal manufacturing of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics in Africa is a strategic focus aimed at enhancing health system resilience and biosafety across the continent. By expanding local production capacities, Africa can reduce dependency on international suppliers, thereby improving the timely availability of essential health commodities during outbreaks and pandemics. This local ecosystem supports not only vaccine development and manufacturing but also technology transfer, regulatory harmonization, innovative financing, and sustainable procurement commitments. These efforts collectively strengthen Africa's ability to prevent and control infectious disease outbreaks, thus directly reinforcing biosafety and health security in the region. The presence of established commercial-scale vaccine production facilities further facilitates rapid emergency vaccine responses, enabling Africa to mobilize local resources promptly in crisis situations [E #1, #2, #4, #9; DC #2; R #3, #25, #29].\n\n### Opportunities and Challenges for China in Technology Sharing, Localization, and Supply Chain Security\n\nChina’s engagement in Africa’s health sector, particularly concerning vaccine and diagnostics production, presents several opportunities. There is a significant potential to contribute to technology transfer initiatives, support regulatory capacity-building, and participate in strengthening supply chains that are critical for immunization programs and outbreak responses. However, challenges include navigating complex regulatory environments, ensuring quality and safety standards are met in local manufacturing, and aligning with Africa-led harmonization efforts. Additionally, overcoming fragmented markets and poor economies of scale in African countries poses difficulties in making local manufacturing sustainable and commercially viable. Collaborative efforts requiring robust public-private partnerships and strategic financing mechanisms are essential to address these challenges effectively [E #2, #36, #37; DC #2, #3; R #3, #37].\n\n### Achieving Win-Win Industrial Cooperation Between China and Africa\n\nTo realize mutually beneficial industrial cooperation, China and African partners need to build on Africa’s strategic frameworks and commitments such as the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), the Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM), and regulatory harmonization initiatives. China can leverage its advanced manufacturing expertise and investment capacity to support scaling up vaccine production facilities and local pharmaceutical ecosystems. Meanwhile, Africa offers a growing market and increasing political commitment toward self-reliance in health commodities. Joint ventures, capacity-building programs, and shared research and development efforts, alongside adherence to quality assurance and sustainable supply chain practices, will create a resilient partnership. Importantly, fostering African ownership, empowering local stakeholders, and aligning with continental health security agendas will ensure that collaborations strengthen both partners’ capabilities and sustain long-term impact [E #1, #24, #27, #31, #35, #49; DC #3, #9; R #3, #37, #49].\n\nIn summary, local production of vaccines and diagnostics is vital for Africa’s biosafety, presenting opportunities for Chinese involvement in technology and capacity sharing. Addressing regulatory, market, and supply chain challenges through strategic cooperation will be key to a successful, sustainable Sino-African industrial partnership in health [DC #1, #2, #3, #9; E #2, #24, #36; R #3, #37].",

    "return": "# Differences in Biosafety Among Major African Regions\n\nThe knowledge base does not explicitly provide detailed, region-specific differences in biosafety practices or challenges across the main African regions (Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, Western Africa). However, the information available highlights some relevant aspects concerning public health, infectious disease threats, and response capacities that imply regional variations in health challenges and focus areas which can relate to biosafety.\n\n## Regional Focus and Public Health Challenges\n\n- **Northern Africa:** This region is actively involved in several public health initiatives, including pathogen genomic activities, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance, mpox preparedness, and broader health emergency strategies. Northern Africa benefits from partnerships focused on strengthening public health systems, emergency preparedness, and immunization efforts [E #8; R #7, #48].\n\n- **Western Africa:** Western Africa hosts several mpox endemic countries and is engaged in emergency response and preparedness as well as in AMR surveillance and pathogen genomic activities. The region is a priority area in continental health strategies aimed at epidemic control and strengthening health systems [E #9; R #29, #42, #49].\n\n- **Central Africa:** Central Africa plays a significant role in mpox surveillance and regional health projects supported by partners such as France. It is also involved in pathogen genomic surveillance and is a focus area for health emergency response, diagnostics decentralization, and tackling antimicrobial resistance [E #25; R #4, #27, #68, #47].\n\n- **Eastern Africa:** Eastern Africa is a critical zone for surveillance of infectious diseases such as visceral leishmaniasis and mpox. It is a main target region for health emergency preparedness, genomic surveillance, and implementation of elimination frameworks for diseases. Eastern Africa also participates actively in regional health initiatives aimed at improving health system resilience [E #26; R #2, #23, #46].\n\n- **Southern Africa:** Southern Africa is engaged in epidemic surveillance, emergency response activities, and pathogen genomic research and is included in initiatives to decentralize diagnostics and accelerate outbreak responses. It is part of broader efforts to combat AMR and enhance health security through regional partnerships [E #33; R #6, #28, #50].\n\n## Implications for Biosafety\n\nWhile explicit biosafety differences are not detailed, the variation in disease burdens (e.g., high mpox incidence in Central and Western Africa, visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern Africa), implementation of genomic surveillance, laboratory capacity, and public health system strengthening across regions suggest differing biosafety profiles and needs. For example, the low capacity of microbiology laboratories (only 1.3% can test for key AMR pathogens in several countries) points to biosafety and diagnostic challenges primarily in less-resourced areas, which may be unevenly distributed.\n\nMoreover, regional partnerships and support systems (e.g., France’s support in Central Africa, EU collaboration continent-wide) address specific local needs, emphasizing regulatory strengthening, diagnostics, and emergency response, key components impacting biosafety measures.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are significant differences in the focus of health threats, surveillance capacities, and public health initiatives related to biosafety among Africa's main regions. These differences stem from:\n\n- Disease prevalence and types (e.g., mpox dominance in Central and Western Africa, VL in Eastern Africa)\n- Laboratory and surveillance capacity disparities\n- Variations in external support and collaborative health programs\n- Differential emphasis on regulatory and diagnostic infrastructure development\n\nThese factors collectively shape the biosafety landscape regionally, implying that biosafety challenges and priorities vary significantly across African regions.\n\nThis understanding is based on thematic summaries of health security, disease surveillance, and emergency response activities outlined for each region in the knowledge base [E #8, #9, #25, #26, #33; R #2, #4, #6, #7, #23, #27, #28, #29, #42, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #68].",

Only a very small fraction—1.3%—of microbiology laboratories in 14 Africa CDC member states have the capacity to test for key AMR pathogens, indicating severely limited diagnostic and surveillance capacity [E #1, #48; R #10, #32; DC #1]. This inadequate laboratory infrastructure hinders timely and accurate detection of resistant pathogens, limiting the effectiveness of intervention and treatment strategies.\n\nAnother challenge is the underfunding of AMR response in Africa. Despite the estimated annual need of USD 2-6 billion to combat AMR effectively, current funding is only about a tenth of that allocated to other major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria [E #4; DC #1]. This financial gap obstructs the scaling-up of surveillance systems, laboratory capacity building, and comprehensive AMR control strategies.\n\nMoreover, a lack of coordinated multi-sectoral leadership and a comprehensive approach across healthcare, agriculture, and food systems exacerbate the problem. This fragmented response undermines efforts to promote the responsible use of antimicrobials and implement sustainable surveillance and control measures [E #2, #12; DC #1]. The AMR threat also impacts agrifood systems and economies, with a weak response in animal health surveillance—only 16% of African countries conduct routine AMR surveillance in animals [E #12; DC #1].\n\n### Successful Strategies and Exemplary Cases\n\nOne notable approach is the multi-sectoral and comprehensive framework adopted in Africa, emphasizing the need for collaborative engagement at all societal levels. Leaders like Dr Raji Tajudeen, Deputy Director General of Africa CDC, advocate for strengthened leadership, expanded surveillance, utilization of data systems, responsible antimicrobial use, and sustainable financing [E #51, #60; DC #1].\n\nCollaboration between Africa CDC and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) exemplifies a successful partnership to improve laboratory capacity for AMR testing and surveillance [E #48; R #10, #61; DC #1]. Their joint efforts seek to ensure the efficacy of treatments and promote data-driven solutions for public health.\n\nAfrican Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), led by Dr Huyam Salih, complements human health efforts by addressing AMR in agrifood systems and animal health, highlighting the importance of integrated leadership and surveillance expansion in these sectors [E #12, #35; DC #1].\n\nAdditionally, the launch of strategic roadmaps and targets through high-level events, such as the African Union Landmark Report on AMR, initiates continent-wide discussions and plans aimed at combating AMR with a long-term vision [E #6; DC #1]. These frameworks aim to guide national and regional policies effectively.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, Africa's challenges in AMR surveillance and laboratory diagnostics are rooted in insufficient diagnostic capacity, critical underfunding, and fragmented multi-sectoral action. Effective response strategies hinge on strengthening leadership, expanding laboratory and surveillance capabilities through partnerships like Africa CDC and ASLM, integrating animal health surveillance under AU-IBAR, and developing strategic roadmaps for coordinated action. These approaches provide hopeful exemplars to mitigate AMR's threat across the continent.\n\n[References: DC #1; E #1, #4, #12, #48, #51; R #10, #32, #61]",

    "return": "### Current State of Biosafety Laboratory Networks in Africa\n\nThe African biosafety laboratory network comprises multiple laboratories coordinated through frameworks such as the Africa CDC Institute for Pathogen Genomics and the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative. These Laboratory Systems and Networks are critical infrastructures supporting diagnostics and pathogen surveillance across the continent, spanning all major regions including Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Africa. \n\nDespite this network, the diagnostic capacity remains uneven and limited in many areas. For example, only 1.3% of microbiology laboratories in 14 Africa CDC member states have the capability to test for key antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogens, indicating a notable gap in laboratory testing capacity for critical public health threats. This highlights challenges in laboratory infrastructure, biosafety, and biosecurity standards across the network [DC #3; E #2, #3, #38, #45; R #12, #33, #38].\n\n### Systemic Approaches to Enhancing Laboratory Capacity and Emergency Response\n\n1. **Collaborative Partnerships**  \nAfrica CDC works closely with multiple partners including the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM), the Africa Public Health Foundation (APHF), WHO, and the private sector to strengthen laboratory systems through support frameworks, coordinated projects, and capacity building [R #3, #4, #12, #20, #44, #45].\n\n2. **Capacity Building and Training**  \nThere are targeted efforts for capacity building through joint training, simulation exercises, benchmarking visits, and learning exchanges aimed at strengthening human resource skills and laboratory preparedness for outbreak detection and response. For example, emergency response training and simulation facilities at regional hubs are equipped to train over 3000 African emergency responders, improving response readiness and operational effectiveness [DC #1; E #5, #11, #18; R #26, #36].\n\n3. **Strengthening Genomic Surveillance and Diagnostics**  \nSignificant progress has been made through initiatives such as the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative and projects co-funded by the European Union and Mastercard Foundation that expanded genomic testing laboratories in Africa from 7 to 40 facilities. This expansion enhances early detection capacities and outbreak response, including molecular diagnostics and genomic surveillance crucial for managing emerging health threats [DC #2; E #2, #30; R #16, #34].\n\n4. **Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP)**  \nThe five-year JEAP collaboration between Africa CDC and WHO focuses on improving surveillance intelligence, genomic sequencing, stockpiling emergency supplies, and rapid deployment of first responders within 24-48 hours. This plan supports integrated laboratory systems within the broader emergency response framework to promptly detect and control outbreaks [DC #7; E #6, #7, #29, #41, #43; R #1, #2, #58, #59, #60].\n\n5. **Supply Chain Optimization and Local Manufacturing**  \nEnhanced supply chain logistics support resilient delivery of essential supplies and vaccines, which complements laboratory testing capabilities and overall health system preparedness. Africa CDC and CEPI partnership emphasize building resilient health systems with optimized supply chains and local vaccine manufacturing capacity to ensure timely outbreak responses [DC #10; E #39; R #21, #22, #46].\n\n### Successful Examples and Impact\n\n- The **expansion of genomic testing** laboratories significantly improved pathogen surveillance capacity, enabling quicker outbreak detection and evidence-informed responses.  \n- The establishment of **Regional Emergency Hubs** by WHO in collaboration with Africa CDC provides centralized resources including laboratories, training facilities, and stockpiles which enhance the continent’s ability to respond swiftly to health emergencies.  \n- Joint initiatives like the **Africa CDC and CEPI partnership** demonstrate success in strengthening laboratory systems, vaccine research and development, manufacturing capacity, and clinical trial infrastructure pivotal to epidemic preparedness [DC #7, #10; E #18, #41, #59; R #18, #19, #23, #24].\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile current biosafety laboratory networks in Africa face capacity and distribution limitations, systemic approaches involving regional collaboration, capacity building, investment in genomics, and integrated emergency preparedness strategies have been proven effective. Ongoing partnerships and strategic initiatives continue to enhance laboratory capabilities and facilitate rapid public health responses to infectious disease threats in resource-constrained environments.\n\n[DC #1, #2, #3, #7, #10; E #2, #3, #5, #6, #11, #18, #30, #38, #39, #41, #45; R #1, #2, #3, #4, #12, #18, #21, #26, #34, #36, #58, #59, #60]",

    "return": "# Biological Security Threats Facing China in Africa\n\nBased on the available knowledge base, the major biological security threats in Africa stem primarily from infectious disease outbreaks and public health emergencies that affect the continent broadly. These epidemics include diseases like mpox (monkeypox), visceral leishmaniasis, and other emerging infectious diseases which have significant social, health, and economic impacts. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) along with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners have been intensively working on surveillance, preparedness, response, and capacity building to address these threats [E #41; R #10, #1, #10].\n\n### Major Biological Security Threats:\n\n- **Infectious Disease Outbreaks:** Africa experiences over 100 health emergencies annually, including outbreaks of mpox, Ebola, Marburg, Cholera, and other infectious diseases [R #30; DC #8].\n- **Mpox Epidemic:** This poses a significant public health threat across various African regions, leading to emergency declarations due to its impact and risk of cross-border spread [E #50; R #48, #52, #53].\n- **Emerging and Recurrent Epidemics:** Diseases like Lassa fever and others with potential pandemic risk threaten health security with implications for vaccine manufacturing and outbreak response [DC #6].\n- **Health Workforce Challenges and Infrastructure Fragility:** The shortage and under-resourcing of health workforce complicate emergency responses and disease control [DC #3].\n- **Climate Change and Conflict-related Emergencies:** These exacerbate risks by increasing vulnerability and destabilizing health systems [R #10, #22].\n\n# Impact on Chinese Personnel, Infrastructure, and Project Operations in Africa\n\nChina's presence in Africa, through personnel and infrastructure investments, could be vulnerable to these biosecurity risks given the widespread nature of outbreaks and systemic challenges in health systems.\n\n### Potential Impacts:\n\n- **Personnel Safety:** Chinese workers and officials in Africa face direct health risks from infectious disease outbreaks which may affect their well-being and disrupt staffing [E #41; R #10].\n- **Infrastructure Stability:** Disease outbreaks and emergency health crises can strain healthcare infrastructure and general service provision, potentially affecting Chinese-built or operated facilities either directly or indirectly [DC #3; R #30].\n- **Operational Disruptions:** Projects, especially those involving logistics, supply chains, and public interaction, may be interrupted by quarantine measures, local health system breakdowns, and travel restrictions due to outbreaks [R #59, #56].\n- **Cross-border Controls and Regulatory Challenges:** Compliance with International Health Regulations and biosecurity measures may cause delays or operational hurdles for projects involving multiple countries [R #50, #70].\n- **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:** Reliance on local or regional medical and logistics supply chains can be disrupted by outbreak-induced stockpiling or transport limitations, affecting timely project execution [R #34, #59].\n- **Need for Capacity Building and Coordination:** Enhanced training, surveillance, and cooperative frameworks are essential to mitigate these risks, requiring continuous engagement from all stakeholders including international partners like China [R #51, #1].\n\nOverall, the biosecurity environment in Africa poses multifaceted threats that require robust emergency preparedness and response systems to protect personnel, infrastructure, and ensure continuity of operations. Collaborative frameworks led by African institutions with international support aim to strengthen these capacities continent-wide.\n\n[Sources: DC \"africa-cdc-and-cepi-deepen-partnership-to-fortify-african-preparedness-against-disease-outbreaks\" #6, #8; DC \"communique-united-in-the-fight-against-mpox-in-africa-high-level-emergency-regional-meeting\" #7; E #50, #41; R #1, #10, #30, #48, #51, #59, #70]",

    "return": "# Overview of the Biosafety Situation in Africa\n\nThe biosafety situation in Africa is framed within the broader context of health security, emphasizing the continent's need to strengthen its health systems to manage infectious disease threats and public health emergencies effectively. Africa CDC, the continental public health agency of the African Union, plays a pivotal role in this regard. The agency focuses on enhancing disease surveillance, emergency preparedness, outbreak response, and strengthening institutional capacities across different African regions including Eastern, Central, Northern, Southern, and Western Africa. These efforts are part of a strategic agenda to improve health sovereignty and resilience against emerging health threats such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and mpox outbreaks [E #41; R #1,3,5,6,28-32].\n\n# Key Areas and Issues in African Biosafety\n\n1. **Disease Surveillance and Outbreak Response:** A major area of focus is on surveillance intelligence, genomic sequencing, and rapid outbreak detection. Africa CDC publishes regular updates and weekly briefs providing vital information to inform ongoing responses to health emergencies, including mpox and AMR-related threats [E #41; R #4,7,9-12,67].\n\n2. **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):** AMR stands out as a critical biosafety concern. Africa has the highest mortality rate from drug-resistant infections in the world, surpassing deaths from HIV-AIDS, TB, and malaria combined. Challenges include misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in healthcare, agriculture, and food systems, insufficient funding, inadequate laboratory capacity for pathogen testing, and limited surveillance, particularly in animal health sectors. AMR threatens human health, food security, livelihoods, economies, and livestock production. Efforts are ongoing to develop a roadmap and targets to combat AMR, requiring multisectoral cooperation [E #8,16,43; R #2,15,28-31,35,36,58,61].\n\n3. **Mpox Outbreaks and Emergency Response:** Mpox has been declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS) by Africa CDC due to its increasing incidence and mortality, particularly in Central and West African regions. Challenges include limited understanding of transmission, low public awareness, vaccine shortages, high vulnerability of populations (e.g., people living with HIV), and cross-border transmission risks. Regional ministerial meetings promote a One Health, multi-sectoral approach addressing mpox through coordinated surveillance, community engagement, cross-border collaboration, and research [E #2,4; R #21,34,44,46-50,62].\n\n4. **Regulatory and Legal Frameworks:** A significant issue pertains to fragmented and lengthy regulatory approval processes that delay access to essential health products. The establishment of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) aims to harmonize medicine regulation across the continent, strengthening quality assurance and improving timely access. Africa CDC collaborates with AMA and international regulators to address these challenges [E #50; R #14,18,22,36,66].\n\n5. **Health Systems Strengthening and Partnerships:** Africa CDC engages with local and international organizations, including WHO, CEPI, EU, and African Union bodies, to improve public health infrastructure, vaccine manufacturing, diagnostics decentralization, and supply chain resilience. Emerging initiatives include strategic EU-AU partnerships, climate-related health projects, and integrated One Health approaches recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health [E #1,4,35,41; R #42].\n\n6. **Laboratory Capacity and Research:** There is a focus on enhancing laboratory networks and capabilities for AMR and pathogen genomic surveillance, critical for effective biosafety monitoring. African Society for Laboratory Medicine collaborates with Africa CDC to improve diagnostic capacity and data-driven public health interventions. Additionally, research activities led by bodies like AHRO contribute to advancing scientific knowledge and health preparedness [E #15,37,52; R #17,33,61].\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOverall, Africa's biosafety situation involves multifaceted efforts to mitigate infectious disease risks through enhanced surveillance, coordinated outbreak response, addressing antimicrobial resistance, regulatory harmonization, and strengthening health systems. Central to this is the role of Africa CDC, supported by international partnerships and regional cooperation, aiming to build a resilient and self-sufficient health security architecture across the continent.\n\n[DC #1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10; E #1,2,4,8,16,28,41,50,52; R #1,2,4,7,14,15,21,28,34,42,44,46-50,58,61,66]",

    "return": "### Major Sources and Types of Biosafety Threats in Africa\n\nThe major sources and types of biosafety threats in Africa encompass a broad spectrum of infectious diseases, epidemics, pandemics, and emergency health situations. The continent faces significant challenges from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as mpox, antimicrobial resistance, and zoonotic diseases, which are transmitted across borders and impact human and animal health, food security, and livelihoods. These threats are compounded by factors such as high prevalence of HIV, malnutrition, low public awareness, limited diagnostic capacity, and frequent cross-border movement, which facilitate disease spread and complicate control efforts [E #41, #47, R #1, #3, #21].\n\n### Specific Risk Characteristics and Priority Control Elements\n\n#### 1. Major Infectious Diseases\nMajor infectious diseases such as mpox, antimicrobial resistance-related infections, and endemic diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS represent critical biosafety threats. For mpox, the risk factors include high case fatality rates especially in vulnerable populations like children and people living with HIV, increased transmission through both sexual and heterosexual networks, and insufficient vaccination and treatment options. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens by reducing treatment efficacy, escalating mortality, and spreading resistant pathogens across human and animal populations. These diseases require surveillance, rapid outbreak response, vaccine development, diagnostic capacity, and sustained public health awareness efforts [E #2, #41, R #13, #47].\n\n#### 2. Cross-border Animal Epidemics\nZoonotic and animal epidemics pose unique risks due to their potential to rapidly spread across national borders facilitated by animal and human movements. African Union entities like AU-IBAR emphasize the threat AMR poses to agrifood systems, food safety, and security, highlighting the interconnectedness of animal health and public health. Control priorities include strict monitoring and regulation based on International Health Regulations (2005), capacity building for joint training and rapid cross-border deployment of health experts, and coordination mechanisms like the Africa Taskforce for Mpox Coordination to harmonize regional efforts [E #43, R #20, #21, #33].\n\n#### 3. Agricultural Biological Invasions\nBiological invasions affecting agriculture threaten food security and economic stability by harming crops and livestock, potentially spreading resistant pathogens, and disrupting supply chains. AMR surveillance in agriculture is underdeveloped in many countries, with only a minority conducting routine monitoring. Addressing this requires multi-sectoral leadership, expanding surveillance systems, promoting responsible use of antimicrobials, improving public and animal health infrastructure, and securing sustainable financing to build resilient agrifood systems [E #43, R #36].\n\n#### 4. Bioterrorism Events\nWhile not explicitly outlined in the provided documents, bioterrorism remains an implied concern within the broader biosafety and health security agenda aiming to prevent and respond to deliberate release of pathogens. Establishing strong emergency preparedness, rapid response capabilities, improved laboratory networks, and coordinated multi-agency frameworks is essential to mitigate such threats. Africa CDC’s collaboration with global partners (WHO, CEPI, US CDC) and adherence to international legal frameworks underpin these preparedness efforts [E #11, #18, R #43, #57].\n\n### Priority Measures for Biosafety Threat Control\n\n- **Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response:** Strengthening detection and reporting systems for human, animal, and environmental health threats.\n- **Cross-border Collaboration:** Ensuring compliance with International Health Regulations and coordinated responses among affected countries.\n- **Research and Capacity Building:** Investing in vaccine development, clinical research, genomic surveillance, and workforce training.\n- **One Health Approach:** Promoting a multi-sectoral, inclusive response that integrates human, animal, and environmental health perspectives.\n- **Public Awareness and Community Engagement:** Enhancing understanding of disease transmission and prevention methods among at-risk populations.\n- **Sustainable Financing and Policy Leadership:** Securing resources and political commitment to implement long-term biosafety strategies.\n- **Rapid Emergency Response:** Mobilizing resources for fast containment and treatment during outbreaks and emergencies [E #36, #37, R #33, #39].\n\nThese comprehensive approaches are necessary to tackle the complex and interconnected biosafety threats facing Africa, ensuring both health security and sustainable development across the continent.\n\n[DC #3, #2, #8, #9, #7; E #41, #43, #47, #36; R #1, #20, #21, #33, #43, #57]",

    "return": "### Introduction to the One Health Approach in Africa\n\nIn the current complex biosecurity landscape, Africa is increasingly adopting the \"One Health\" approach, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of human health, animal health, and environmental sectors. This multidisciplinary strategy is critical in tackling health emergencies that transcend traditional sectors, such as zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and environmental health risks.\n\n### Cross-sectoral Collaboration and Coordination\n\nAfrican health leaders recognize the necessity of integrative efforts among various sectors. For instance, Ministers of Health from several African countries including Angola, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, and Uganda have explicitly committed to promoting a One Health community-centered and inclusive approach for dealing with outbreaks like mpox. This involves ensuring multi-sectoral collaboration, joint planning, data sharing, resource allocation, and community engagement to enhance disease control efforts across borders [R #31, #29, #53, #44].\n\n### Role of Africa CDC and Partnerships\n\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) plays a pivotal role in fostering such cross-sectoral collaboration. As a continental autonomous public health agency under the African Union, Africa CDC supports member states in strengthening health systems and combating health threats through coordinated epidemic responses. It facilitates collaboration among sectors to mobilize resources, provide technical assistance, and enhance surveillance and response capabilities aligned with the One Health concept [E #18, R #53, #41, #43].\n\nMoreover, Africa CDC partners with organizations such as the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), which is actively involved in addressing AMR and other animal health concerns, reinforcing the link between animal, human, and environmental health. AU-IBAR under the leadership of Dr Huyam Salih emphasizes that AMR is a threat beyond health, impacting food safety, security, livelihoods, and economies, thereby requiring integrated approaches [R #35, #30; E #17].\n\n### Resource Optimization and Strategic Initiatives\n\nTo optimize resource allocation and improve health security, Africa CDC and partners have launched several strategic initiatives. These include the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP), a five-year collaboration with WHO designed to improve surveillance intelligence, stockpiling emergency supplies, deploying rapid responders, and strengthening emergency systems at country and regional levels [R #1, #44; DC #5, #6].\n\nFurthermore, multi-sectoral collaborations aim to bolster local vaccine manufacturing, supply chain optimization, and laboratory capacity strengthening, which are critical for sustainable health security. Africa CDC's partnerships extend to various sectors including public health, agriculture, and environment to build these capacities and coordinate emergency response efforts in a One Health framework [R #12, #14, #58; DC #2].\n\n### The Commitment to Multi-sectoral Investment and Governance\n\nInvestment in health workforce and governance is a crucial part of the One Health approach. Africa CDC, alongside African Union departments and international partners, promotes sustainable financing strategies to support integrated health workforce capabilities, emphasizing community health workers' empowerment and regional coordination mechanisms [R #33, #37, #9; E #46].\n\nThe Ministers’ commitment to One Health also underlines enhancing leadership, ownership, and inclusive community-centered response mechanisms that align with cross-border collaboration and surveillance, aiming at more efficient resource utilization and coordinated action across sectors [R #31, #29].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfrica’s application of the One Health approach manifests through coordinated multi-sectoral cooperation, strategic partnerships led by Africa CDC, and integrated frameworks such as JEAP. These efforts optimize the use of limited resources and leverage the strengths of health, agriculture, and environmental sectors collectively to enhance the continent’s capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to biosecurity threats effectively.\n\nThis integrated One Health strategy supports sustainable development goals by addressing health threats holistically and fostering resilient health systems across African member states [R #31, #53, #30; DC #5, #6, #7].\n\n---\n\nThis summary is based on the information extracted from multiple documents and relations in Africa CDC and related organizations’ resources, including \"communique-united-in-the-fight-against-mpox-in-africa-high-level-emergency-regional-meeting,\" \"africa-cdc-and-who-launch-joint-emergency-preparedness-and-response-action-plan-jeap-to-strengthen-health-systems-and-combat-disease-outbreaks-in-africa,\" and \"antimicrobial-resistance-is-a-greater-threat-than-hiv-aids-tb-and-malaria-says-new-report\" [R #31, #53, #1, #5, #7, #35].",

    "return": "### Differences and Main Challenges in Biosafety Governance, Legal, and Regulatory Frameworks among African Countries\n\nAfrican countries exhibit significant differences and face several challenges in biosafety governance, legal frameworks, and institutional setups related to health product regulation and public health emergency preparedness.\n\n#### Differences\n\n1. **Regulatory Maturity and Harmonization**  \n   The regulatory approval processes across African countries are historically fragmented and often lengthy, leading to delays in market access for locally manufactured health products. Some countries have acquired Maturity Level 3 (ML3) status in regulatory capabilities, which supports better oversight throughout the lifecycle of vaccine production. However, many others still struggle with developing efficient regulatory pathways that meet international quality and safety standards [DC #4; E #40; R #40].\n\n2. **Domestication of Continental Regulatory Frameworks**  \n   There is variable progress among African countries in domesticating the African Union Model Law aimed at harmonizing national regulations on medicines and health products. Some health ministers have advocated for fast-tracking this harmonization to support the distribution of medicines and to assure quality control, yet full adoption remains a work in progress across the continent [E #3; R #33, 34].\n\n3. **Legal and Institutional Infrastructure**  \n   Countries differ in preparedness concerning their legal and regulatory processes, including cross-border cooperation frameworks essential for epidemic control measures such as mpox response. Coordination of rapid deployment of public health experts and medical personnel requires well-developed legal and logistical arrangements, which are not uniformly established [E #30; R #52].\n\n#### Main Challenges\n\n1. **Fragmented and Lengthy Regulatory Processes**  \n   The protracted and disjointed approval procedures impose financial and administrative burdens on manufacturers and delay access to essential health products. Achieving WHO prequalification remains a critical yet challenging milestone necessary for accessing international procurement systems and scaling manufacturing sustainably [E #4, #5; DC #4].\n\n2. **Capacity Gaps in Regulatory and Technical Expertise**  \n   Despite competency development programs such as those offered by Regional Centres for Regulatory Excellence (RCOREs), many countries lack sufficient regulatory expertise and infrastructure to effectively oversee vaccine and medicine production, ensuring quality and safety [E #48; R #7].\n\n3. **Legal and Policy Coordination for Emergency Response**  \n   The need for harmonized legal frameworks to facilitate inter-country cooperation during health emergencies, including surveillance, data sharing, and resource mobilization, is critical. However, inconsistencies in legislation and coordination mechanisms hinder rapid and effective responses to outbreaks and biosafety threats [E #30; R #52].\n\n4. **Integration of Biosafety Measures in Broader Health Security Frameworks**  \n   Biosafety governance is often embedded within larger health security and emergency preparedness agendas, requiring coordination among multiple stakeholders, including national governments, regional bodies, and international partners. This complexity creates challenges in developing coherent, enforceable biosafety policies tailored to country contexts [E #13; R #4].\n\n5. **Political and Socio-economic Barriers**  \n   Political considerations and social unrest, including conflict, exacerbate the challenges in governance and legal implementation, weakening public health infrastructure and emergency response capacities [E #18, #19; R #53].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfrican countries face notable disparities in biosafety governance and the development of legal and regulatory frameworks. Key challenges include fragmented regulatory systems, gaps in expertise and infrastructure, uneven adoption of harmonized laws, and weaknesses in emergency legal coordination. Addressing these issues requires sustained political commitment, regional collaboration, capacity building, and alignment with continental initiatives such as the African Medicines Agency and the African Union Model Law to foster a resilient and harmonized biosafety governance system across Africa.\n\n[DC #4, #5; E #3, #4, #30, #40, #48; R #7, #33, #34, #52, #53]",

    "return": "# Challenges in Enhancing Biosafety and Disease Prevention in Africa\n\nEnhancing biosafety and disease prevention capabilities in Africa faces core challenges in several specific areas:\n\n1. **Disease Surveillance and Monitoring:** Despite advances, there is still a need for strengthening pathogen genomic surveillance and outbreak response capabilities across African countries. The decentralization of diagnostics and expansion of molecular diagnostics remain ongoing challenges [DC #1; E #2; R #1, 6].\n\n2. **Vaccine Self-Production and Manufacturing Capacity:** Africa aims to produce 60% of its vaccine needs locally by 2040. However, vaccine manufacturing capacity, research and development (R&D), and supply chain optimization are still insufficient, which hampers rapid and equitable vaccine access [E #5, #46; R #23, 24, 26, 28; DC #2].\n\n3. **Cross-Border Collaboration:** The control of infectious diseases like mpox requires enhanced cross-border collaboration involving data sharing, joint planning, and resource distribution, yet legal and logistical frameworks for rapid cross-border deployment of public health experts remain limited [E #43, #19; R #6].\n\n4. **Public Risk Communication and Health Education:** While communication units exist within Africa CDC and allied bodies, there is a continuous need to effectively coordinate outreach and public information dissemination to foster community engagement and support [E #26].\n\n5. **Legal and Regulatory Coordination:** There are challenges in harmonizing regulatory processes to assure quality and safety of health products, and to expedite regulatory approvals for vaccines and therapeutics. The African Medicines Agency (AMA) is an important step toward regulatory harmonization, but practical implementation and collaboration with national and regional authorities require reinforcement [E #49, #38; R #14, 38].\n\n# Policy Recommendations for Stakeholders\n\nTo address these challenges, various stakeholders need to undertake coordinated and practical policy actions:\n\n### Governments\n- Strengthen national public health institutions focusing on surveillance, laboratory capacity, and health workforce development to enhance disease detection and outbreak management [E #8, #15].\n- Commit to purchasing and supporting locally manufactured vaccines to stimulate the vaccine manufacturing ecosystem and health sovereignty [E #52; R #52].\n- Facilitate legal and regulatory reforms promoting rapid and harmonized review processes for health products [E #19, #16].\n\n### Regional and Continental Organizations\n- Africa CDC should continue to lead the integration and coordination of genomic surveillance networks and the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative to improve real-time disease monitoring and data sharing [E #5, #60; R #6, #60].\n- Support mechanisms like the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator to expand and sustain vaccine and therapeutics manufacturing capacity regionally [E #46; R #46].\n- Promote frameworks to facilitate cross-border cooperation for outbreak preparedness, including the rapid deployment of technical experts and information sharing platforms [E #43; R #6, #71].\n\n### International and Technical Partners\n- Provide technical and financial support for capacity building in epidemiological surveillance, vaccine R&D, clinical trial infrastructure, and health emergency preparedness (e.g., CEPI, WHO, UNICEF, USAID) [E #44, #10, #37, #47; R #1, #7, #8, #10].\n- Collaborate in regulatory strengthening initiatives through knowledge-sharing and harmonization efforts, supporting AMA's role and linking with agencies such as EMA [E #49, #51; R #14, #17].\n- Fund and support public health communication projects to enhance risk communication and community engagement [E #26].\n\nIn conclusion, overcoming the core biosafety and disease control challenges in Africa demands a sustained, multi-sectoral collaborative approach involving national leadership, regional coordination, and global partnership to build resilient health systems and ensure health security for the continent [E #5, #18, #4; R #3, #44, #48; DC #2, #4].",

    "return": "### Policies and Capacity Building Measures in Africa for Major Biosafety Threats (AMR and Mpox)\n\nAt both the national and regional levels, African countries have adopted multifaceted policies and capacity-building initiatives to address significant biosafety threats such as Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and Mpox (monkeypox).\n\n#### Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\n\nAfrican governments and institutions have recognized AMR as a critical health challenge exceeding the mortality impact of HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and partners have launched comprehensive reports and strategic roadmaps, such as the African Union Landmark Report, to highlight AMR's threat and mobilize action. Capacity-building efforts focus on expanding laboratory capacity, improving diagnostics, and enhancing surveillance systems, though current lab capability remains low (only about 1.3% of microbiology labs in some member states can test for key AMR pathogens).\n\nPolicies emphasize multi-sectoral engagement, including animal health systems under the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), to integrate agrifood systems and public health. There are calls for sustainable financing and strengthening leadership and governance to address AMR comprehensively. However, funding remains substantially under-resourced, with annual needs estimated between USD 2-6 billion but current funding is only a fraction of this amount, limiting effective response capacity. AMR also threatens progress toward Africa’s socio-economic development and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n#### Mpox (Monkeypox)\n\nMpox has been declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security by Africa CDC since August 2024, reflecting its epidemiological severity and social impact. Policy frameworks involve multi-sectoral and cross-border collaboration coordinated through the Africa Taskforce for Mpox Coordination among affected and at-risk member states. Key measures include establishing surveillance and laboratory diagnostic capabilities, capacity building through joint training, simulation exercises, and research consortia such as the Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC), which promotes multi-country, interdisciplinary research and surveillance.\n\nGovernments commit to 'One Health' approaches ensuring inclusive and community-centered response mechanisms, with emphasis on overcoming stigma, providing integrated clinical care, and accelerating access to vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Cross-border collaboration with real-time data sharing and coordinated epidemic response planning is prioritized.\n\n#### Institutional and Practical Challenges\n\nThe main challenges impacting the efficacy of policies and capacity building include:\n\n1. **Insufficient Health System Capacities**: Limited laboratory and diagnostic infrastructure constrain effective surveillance and response. The low availability of essential antimicrobial drugs and mpox vaccines impedes outbreak control.\n\n2. **Funding Gaps**: AMR response is critically underfunded relative to its burden. Similarly, limited resources affect mpox outbreak containment and vaccine deployment.\n\n3. **Low Public Awareness and Stigma**: Lack of awareness about mpox transmission modes complicates control efforts, while stigma affecting key populations presents barriers to effective interventions.\n\n4. **Cross-Border Coordination**: Although mechanisms exist for collaboration, challenges remain in harmonized implementation and data sharing among neighboring countries.\n\n5. **Complex Transmission Dynamics**: For mpox, changing epidemiology, including concerns about vertical transmission and afeguarding vulnerable populations like children and people living with HIV, require adaptive strategies.\n\n6. **Regulatory and Logistical Barriers**: For vaccines and medical countermeasures, regulatory processes and logistics for rapid deployment need strengthening, as endorsed in various regional frameworks.\n\n7. **Multi-sectoral Integration**: Addressing AMR and mpox requires coordination across human health, animal health, agriculture, and environmental sectors, posing organizational and operational complexity.\n\nOverall, Africa’s response to these biosafety threats integrates regional coordination led by Africa CDC and WHO, emphasizing health systems strengthening, research collaboration, capacity building, and resource mobilization, yet contending with systemic resource and infrastructure limitations that challenge rapid and effective containment and mitigation efforts.\n\n\n[DC #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7; E #2, #10, #27, #40, #41; R #10, #12, #25, #30, #41, #44, #61, #67]",

    "return": "# Major Biosafety Threats in Africa\n\nAfrica currently faces several significant biosafety threats primarily driven by infectious diseases that present challenges to public health across the continent.\n\n## 1. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\n\nOne of the foremost biosafety threats is antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which has become a greater threat than HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in terms of mortality rates in Africa. AMR occurs when microorganisms—such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites—develop resistance to antimicrobial drugs, leading to treatment failures, increased transmission, severe illness, and higher death rates. This phenomenon is accelerated by human behaviors, especially the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial drugs in healthcare, agriculture, and food systems. The AMR crisis is compounded by insufficient surveillance, inadequate laboratory testing capacity (only 1.3% of microbiology labs can test key AMR pathogens in some member states), and considerable underfunding, which impedes effective response and control. Vulnerable groups, including children, bear the greatest risk. AMR also threatens agrifood systems, food security, livelihoods, and economic stability, with potential declines in livestock production and soaring healthcare costs projected by 2050. Addressing AMR requires multisectoral collaboration, strengthened surveillance, responsible antimicrobial use, and sustainable financing [DC #1; E #1, #12, #38, #43].\n\n## 2. Infectious Disease Outbreaks, including Mpox\n\nAnother critical biosafety threat comprises infectious disease outbreaks such as mpox (monkeypox). Mpox has been declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS) by Africa CDC due to its rising case counts—over 40,000 cases and 1,500 deaths reported since 2022—and its potential to spread regionally and globally. The disease exhibits changing transmission dynamics, with heterosexual transmission noted among female sex workers in certain regions like DR Congo, and carries a high case fatality rate, especially among children under 15 and people living with HIV. Challenges in controlling mpox include limited availability of vaccines and medical countermeasures, insufficient public awareness, poor understanding of transmission modes, cross-border movement that facilitates spread, and constrained response capacity in healthcare systems. These outbreaks impact economies and social structures and require coordinated continental action, community-centered One Health approaches, surveillance, information sharing, and adherence to international health regulations [DC #5, #6; E #10, #12, #13, #49, #51, #53, #54].\n\n## 3. Climate-Related Health Challenges\n\nClimate change exacerbates health risks by increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases and other health emergencies. Addressing these climate-driven health challenges is an integral focus within the AU-EU health collaboration framework, with investments supporting adaptation and resilience of health systems against both direct and indirect impacts of climate variability [E #5, #39].\n\n# Summary of Causes\n\nThe biosafety threats in Africa stem from a combination of factors:\n\n- Human behaviors, including misuse and overuse of antimicrobials.\n- Limited laboratory and surveillance infrastructure hindering early detection.\n- Insufficient funding for AMR and outbreak responses.\n- Inadequate public awareness and understanding leading to ineffective control measures.\n- High vulnerability of populations due to HIV prevalence, malnutrition, and other social determinants.\n- Cross-border movements facilitating spread of infectious diseases.\n- Emerging challenges posed by climate change impacting disease dynamics.\n- Gaps in vaccine availability and health system preparedness.\n\nContinent-wide efforts involving governments, regional institutions like Africa CDC, international partners, and multisectoral collaboration under frameworks such as the One Health approach and International Health Regulations are critical to tackling these biosafety threats effectively and sustainably [DC #1, #2, #3, #5, #6, #8; E #3, #12, #41, #49, #58; R #2, #12, #16, #39, #48, #49, #53].\n\n---\n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview strictly based on the referenced content without extrapolation or addition of outside information.",

    "return": "### Strategies Implemented in Biosafety Control and Governance in African Countries and Regions\n\nAfrican countries and regions have adopted several concrete strategies focused on biosafety control and governance, particularly in response to infectious diseases such as mpox and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Key measures include:\n\n1. **One Health Approach**  \n   Many African Union member states promote a One Health approach, emphasizing a multi-sectoral and community-centered strategy that integrates human, animal, and environmental health sectors. This approach fosters inclusive response mechanisms to effectively manage outbreaks like mpox by coordinating efforts across ministries and partners. National governments have committed to developing and implementing multi-sectoral plans and establishing accountability mechanisms that include community engagement and participation [DC #10; R #38].\n\n2. **Surveillance and Laboratory Diagnostic Capabilities**  \n   Strengthening surveillance systems and laboratory diagnostic capacities is a priority. Efforts include developing structured national laboratory networks, enhancing epidemic detection and risk assessment capabilities through better surveillance, and improving biosafety and biosecurity measures in laboratories. Countries are also implementing digitized real-time data sharing and cross-border collaboration to enhance outbreak preparedness and response. The establishment of legal and regulatory processes supports rapid deployment of public health experts and resources during outbreaks [DC #6; DC #10; R #45].\n\n3. **Regulatory and Legal Frameworks**  \n   African countries focus on strengthening regulatory processes. This includes coordinated efforts with bodies such as the African Medicines Agency (AMA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and World Health Organization (WHO) to harmonize regulations and facilitate equitable access to medical countermeasures, vaccines, and diagnostics. Legal frameworks also facilitate rapid cross-border deployment of health personnel and resources to manage public health emergencies effectively [DC #2; R #40, #65].\n\n4. **Research and Evidence-based Interventions**  \n   There is an emphasis on supporting research for better understanding disease epidemiology and transmission dynamics. For instance, the establishment of research groups like the Mpox Research Consortium promotes multi-country collaborations for outcome monitoring, surveillance, and advancing clinical research capacities. These research efforts inform evidence-based policies and enhance the development and equitable access to safe and effective medical countermeasures [DC #9; DC #10].\n\n5. **Information Sharing and Capacity Building**  \n   Rapid information exchange on health threats and preparedness is facilitated through taskforces and coordinated networks among affected states. Training, learning exchanges, benchmarking visits, and simulation exercises are conducted to build human resource capacity and preparedness for outbreak responses [DC #6; R #62].\n\n### Effectiveness of These Measures\n\n- The adoption of the One Health approach and multi-sectoral coordination has improved inclusivity and community engagement in outbreak responses, leading to more coordinated regional actions for diseases like mpox.\n- Enhanced surveillance and laboratory capacities have strengthened early detection, monitoring, and risk assessment, although laboratory capacity remains limited in some regions, such as microbiology labs capable of AMR testing being only 1.3% in 14 member states.\n- Regulatory harmonization and collaboration with agencies like AMA and EMA have streamlined pathways for access to health products, fostering local manufacturing and vaccine accessibility, contributing to health system resilience.\n- Research collaborations have filled critical knowledge gaps, contributing to informed control strategies and vaccine trial readiness in endemic areas.\n\n### Main Challenges Faced\n\n- **Limited Laboratory and Diagnostic Capacity**  \n  Despite improvements, many countries still face low diagnostic capabilities, restricting surveillance and prompt response to infectious threats like AMR and mpox [DC #1].\n  \n- **Insufficient Public Awareness and Understanding**  \n  Low public awareness and limited understanding of diseases, such as mpox transmission modes, impede effective containment and control [R #49, #51].\n\n- **Insufficient Response Capacities**  \n  Gaps such as vaccine shortages and inadequate healthcare infrastructure hinder swift outbreak management and reduce the effectiveness of response measures [R #46].\n\n- **Funding Shortfalls**  \n  AMR response efforts are notably underfunded—receiving only a fraction of financial resources compared to other diseases—limiting the scale and sustainability of interventions [DC #1].\n\n- **Coordination Barriers**  \n  Cross-border collaboration is essential but complicated by logistical, legal, and regulatory differences among countries, necessitating further harmonization and planning [DC #6, #10].\n\n- **Human and Technical Resource Constraints**  \n  Building and retaining qualified health workforce and ensuring consistent training and capacity building remain ongoing challenges for sustained emergency preparedness [DC #6; R #68].\n\nOverall, African countries demonstrate a strong commitment to biosafety control and governance through integrated approaches, strengthened surveillance, regulatory harmonization, and research. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is tempered by systemic challenges related to capacity, awareness, funding, and coordination that need continuous attention.\n\n[DC #1, #2, #6, #9, #10; R #38, #40, #45, #46, #49, #51, #62, #65, #68]",

    "return": "### Major Biosafety Threats and Risks Facing Africa\n\nAfrica is currently confronting several significant biosafety threats and risks that impact public health security, agricultural systems, and socio-economic development across the continent. These threats are largely shaped by infectious disease outbreaks, antimicrobial resistance, and challenges in health system preparedness and response.\n\n#### 1. Infectious Disease Outbreaks: Mpox as a Public Health Emergency\nOne of the foremost biosafety threats in Africa is the Mpox outbreak, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS) by Africa CDC as of August 13, 2024. The Mpox situation is severe and worsening, with escalating cases and deaths across multiple African Union member states. Factors complicating the outbreak include high transmission rates, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children and people living with HIV, insufficient vaccination strategies, limited access to medical countermeasures like vaccines and treatments, poor detection capacities, and low public awareness. These challenges contribute to the increased risk of spread both within Africa and globally, thus constituting a considerable public health risk and a threat to global health security. Cross-border movement, social vulnerabilities, and gaps in response capabilities exacerbate the emergency [DC #3; E #3; R #22, 25, 26, 30, 52].\n\n#### 2. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\nAnother critical biosafety risk is antimicrobial resistance, which is described as a greater threat than HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in Africa. AMR represents the capacity of microbes including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites to resist antimicrobial drugs, complicating treatment outcomes and causing increased mortality and disease transmission. Africa bears the highest mortality rate related to AMR, disproportionately affecting children and vulnerable populations. The crisis is worsened by underfunding, scant laboratory capacity for proper detection (only 1.3% of labs can test for key AMR pathogens), and insufficient routine surveillance across human health and animal agriculture sectors. AMR also undermines food safety and security by threatening livestock production and agrifood systems, thereby impacting livelihoods and economies continent-wide. The under-resourced response to AMR poses a significant barrier to sustainable development goals and Africa’s socio-economic transformation plans (Agenda 2063). Coordinated multisectoral efforts involving surveillance, responsible antimicrobial use, capacity building, and sustainable financing are urgently needed [DC #2, #6; E #5, #8, #28; R #2, 14, 29–33, 37, 53–56].\n\n#### 3. Health System Preparedness and Emergency Response Capacity\nAfrica CDC, along with partners including local and international organizations, emphasizes strengthening emergency preparedness and response capabilities to manage biosafety risks effectively. This includes enhancing disease surveillance, genomic sequencing, diagnostics decentralization, vaccine manufacturing, workforce training, and rapid deployment of response teams. The coordination through initiatives like the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) and strategic partnerships with entities such as the EU, France, and the U.S. government aim to bolster health security architecture and institutional capacities. Continuous information dissemination through weekly briefs, media advisories, and press releases also helps maintain situational awareness and coordinated actions across the continent [DC #1, #4, #5, #7, #10; E #7, #11, #41, #44; R #1, 3, 7, 12, 13, 17, 42, 44].\n\n#### 4. Regulatory and Logistic Challenges\nDelays in regulatory approval processes, fragmented regulatory systems, and limited infrastructure for local manufacturing of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics further exacerbate Africa’s ability to respond effectively to biosafety threats. Efforts to harmonize regulatory frameworks, accelerate approvals via WHO policies, and strengthen regulatory capacities with the support of the African Medicines Agency and collaborations with the European Medicines Agency are underway to address these challenges. Additionally, ensuring vaccine safety protocols and improving cold chain logistics are essential to guarantee effective deployment of health products [DC #7; E #24, #27, #32, #50; R #16, 39, 60].\n\nIn summary, Africa’s primary biosafety threats encompass infectious disease outbreaks such as the Mpox emergency, the growing crisis of antimicrobial resistance, gaps in emergency health preparedness, and systemic regulatory challenges. Addressing these risks requires sustained investment, strong partnerships, multisectoral coordination, and enhanced surveillance and response capacities across the continent.\n\n[DC #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #10; E #3, #5, #8, #11, #24, #27, #28, #32, #41, #50; R #2, 7, 14, 16, 22, 25, 26, 29, 30, 37, 39, 44, 52, 53, 60]",

    "return": "### Overview of the Current Biosafety Situation in Africa\n\nAfrica faces a complex and challenging biosafety landscape characterized by a high burden of infectious diseases, frequent outbreaks, and the ongoing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The continent experiences a significant number of health emergencies annually, with over 130 disease outbreaks reported, placing immense pressure on already fragile health systems. These emergencies include endemic diseases such as mpox, as well as emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, which necessitate continuous surveillance, rapid response, and coordinated cross-border actions to mitigate their impact [DC #2; E #16, #41, #49].\n\n### Key Trends and Characteristics\n\n1. **High Burden of Infectious Diseases and AMR Threat**  \n   Africa bears the highest mortality rate from antimicrobial resistance, exceeding deaths from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. AMR presents a multifaceted threat extending beyond health to food safety, security, and economic stability, particularly affecting vulnerable groups such as children. Surveillance and response to AMR are uneven across regions, with only a minority of countries conducting routine animal health surveillance. This situation underscores the urgent need for comprehensive, multisectoral strategies addressing both human and animal health sectors [DC #3; E #2, #43, #47].\n\n2. **Increased Emphasis on Genomic Surveillance and Diagnostic Decentralization**  \n   Strengthening pathogen genomic initiatives and molecular diagnostic capacities across Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Africa is a prominent focus to enhance early detection and characterization of pathogens. Africa CDC leads efforts to decentralize diagnostics and promote genomic surveillance to accelerate outbreak response and improve preparedness for future epidemics [DC #4; R #1, #4, #5].\n\n3. **Partnerships and Capacity Building for Preparedness and Response**  \n   Collaborative partnerships, including those with organizations such as CEPI, the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), and international donors like the UK government, support the improvement of vaccine safety protocols, biosecurity, and emergency preparedness. These efforts aim to build resilient health systems capable of managing recurrent outbreaks and advancing local vaccine manufacturing, reinforcing health sovereignty and equitable access to medical countermeasures [DC #2, #9; E #3, #4, #20, #24; R #19, #20, #44, #58].\n\n4. **Designation of Public Health Emergencies and Regional Coordination**  \n   Africa CDC has declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS), reflecting the disease’s significant threat to continental and global health security. Such designations enable mobilization of continent-wide resources and coordinated response efforts, guided by frameworks such as the International Health Regulations (2005) and supported by regional emergency hubs and advisory groups, including the Emergency Preparedness and Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG) [E #12, #16, #50; R #16, #17, #53].\n\n5. **Persistent Challenges in Regulatory Harmonization and Resource Allocation**  \n   Fragmented and lengthy regulatory approval processes in African countries present barriers to timely market access for vaccines and health products. While some countries have achieved advanced regulatory maturity, harmonized pathways and WHO prequalification remain critical for efficient manufacturing and distribution. Additionally, funding gaps exist for critical issues like AMR response, posing risks to sustainable development and health security goals [E #25, #39, #40; R #25, #39, #40].\n\n### Summary\n\nOverall, Africa’s biosafety situation reflects a continent managing a high volume of infectious threats compounded by antimicrobial resistance, necessitating strengthened surveillance, coordinated emergency response, enhanced regional manufacturing capabilities, and regulatory improvements. The active role of Africa CDC and strategic partnerships underscore systemic efforts aimed at elevating the continent’s preparedness and resilience in the face of ongoing and emerging public health challenges.\n\n[DC #2, #3, #4, #9; E #2, #3, #4, #16, #20, #24, #25, #41, #43, #47, #49, #50; R #2, #16, #17, #19, #20, #25, #39, #40, #44, #58]",

    "return": "### Key Indicators of Africa’s Biological Defense Capacities\n\nAfrica has made considerable strides in strengthening its biological defense infrastructure, particularly in areas such as laboratory diagnostic networks, molecular and genomic detection capabilities, vaccine accessibility, and early warning and reporting systems. Notable advancements include:\n\n- **Expansion of Genomic Testing Laboratories:** Through initiatives like the Saving Lives and Livelihoods (SLL) initiative, genomic testing capacity in Africa has expanded significantly from 7 to 40 laboratories, enhancing disease surveillance and outbreak response capabilities across the continent.\n\n- **Laboratory Systems and Networks:** Africa CDC collaborates with organizations like the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM), Africa Public Health Foundation (APHF), Member States, and Africa Laboratory Technical Working Group to strengthen laboratory diagnostic and surveillance systems continent-wide.\n\n- **Integrated Molecular and Genomic Surveillance:** Projects such as the Integrated Genomic Surveillance and Data Sharing Platform (IGS) and the Integrated Genomic Surveillance for Outbreak Detection (DETECT) are pivotal to improving outbreak detection and antimicrobial resistance genomic surveillance. These efforts are co-funded by the European Union and implemented in partnership with various African and international stakeholders, reflecting a strategic shift towards a resilient and integrated molecular diagnostic ecosystem.\n\n- **Vaccines and Medical Countermeasures:** Partnerships between Africa CDC and CEPI focus on expanding vaccine research, development, manufacturing capabilities, and emergency vaccine response preparedness to address epidemics rapidly and equitably.\n\n- **Early Disease Detection and Reporting:** The Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP), a five-year strategic collaboration between Africa CDC and the WHO, prioritizes strengthening surveillance intelligence, genomic sequencing, and rapid information sharing. It also establishes frameworks for stockpiling emergency supplies and deploying first responders to contain outbreaks swiftly.\n\n### Main Shortcomings and Their Impacts\n\nDespite these advances, critical gaps remain that impact the continent’s ability to monitor, respond to, and control epidemics effectively:\n\n- **Low Diagnostic Capacity for Antimicrobial Resistance:** Only 1.3% of microbiology laboratories in 14 Africa CDC member states have the capability to test for key antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogens. This limited diagnostic infrastructure hinders efficient AMR surveillance, risking uncontrolled spread of drug-resistant infections which are already causing significant mortality rates exceeding those of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria in Africa.\n\n- **Vaccine Availability and Distribution:** Although vaccine manufacturing is improving, local production still accounts for a fraction of the continent’s needs with ambitious targets set for 2040. Limited access to vaccines and other medical countermeasures continues to impact outbreak control, notably during epidemics like mpox, where vaccine and treatment availability remains constrained.\n\n- **Fragmented and Uneven Laboratory and Surveillance Networks:** While there are coordinated efforts, inconsistencies in laboratory capabilities, data quality, and surveillance practice across different regions limit rapid and accurate detection of emerging threats.\n\n- **Cross-border Coordination and Data Sharing Challenges:** The effectiveness of epidemic response relies heavily on timely information exchange and collaboration among neighboring countries. Gaps in real-time data sharing and coordination can delay outbreak detection and hamper coordinated responses, especially in high-risk border zones.\n\n- **Workforce and Institutional Capacity:** Continued need exists for capacity building in health workforce, including providing training, benchmarking, and ensuring sufficient staffing for epidemic response, which affects the speed and effectiveness of deployment during health emergencies.\n\n### Consequences for Epidemic Monitoring, Early Response, and Risk Control\n\nThe deficiencies in diagnostic capacity, vaccine accessibility, surveillance uniformity, and cross-border coordination create specific challenges:\n\n- **Delayed Outbreak Detection:** Insufficient molecular and genomic testing capacity slows identification of pathogens and variants, undermining early warning systems.\n\n- **Suboptimal Response Speed:** Without adequate stockpiling of supplies, rapid deployment of trained responders, and efficient coordination mechanisms, containment efforts lag, allowing outbreaks to expand.\n\n- **Increased Morbidity and Mortality:** Gaps in AMR surveillance and limited vaccine availability contribute to higher transmission rates and deaths, notably for diseases such as mpox and drug-resistant infections.\n\n- **Economic and Social Impacts:** Prolonged outbreaks due to slow detection and response worsen socio-economic disruptions in affected communities.\n\nAddressing these gaps is central to Africa CDC and partners’ ongoing initiatives, which emphasize integrated genomic surveillance, expansion of laboratory networks, strengthening of vaccine manufacturing and delivery systems, and enhanced multi-sectoral collaboration across the continent.\n\n[DC #3, #5, #6, #1, #4, #8; E #6, #13, #41, #42; R #1, #12, #19, #27, #31, #40, #61]",

    "return": "### Structural Factors Affecting Biosafety and Disease Control Capacity in Nigeria, Uganda, and Chad\n\nThe structural factors limiting the enhancement of biosafety and disease control capabilities in African countries such as Nigeria, Uganda, and Chad include deficiencies in governance systems, legal and regulatory frameworks, funding, laboratory and disease control networks, specialized personnel, and cross-border cooperation. Although the knowledge base does not provide detailed country-specific breakdowns for these three countries individually, it offers thematic insights into these structural challenges and their impacts which broadly apply to many African nations, including Nigeria, Uganda, and Chad.\n\n### Governance and Legal Frameworks\n\nGovernance and regulatory systems in Africa experience fragmentation and lengthy processes that delay effective disease surveillance and response. Efforts to strengthen and harmonize regulatory processes are ongoing at national and regional levels through programs such as the Regional Centres for Regulatory Excellence (RCOREs) and initiatives involving the African Medicines Agency (AMA). However, challenges remain in fast-tracking regulatory harmonization and domesticating model laws, which are vital for improving biosafety oversight and ensuring coordinated public health actions across borders [E #3, #5, #29; R #42, #62].\n\n### Funding and Resources\n\nSustainable funding remains a critical bottleneck. Many countries suffer from inadequate financial resources to support health systems comprehensively. The African Health Workforce Investment Charter aims to mobilize both domestic and partner funding to strengthen, grow, and retain the health workforce, especially in underserved settings. Nonetheless, challenges such as insufficient investment, under-prioritization of health workforce financing, and limited domestic funding constrain long-term capacity building [E #8, #28, #58; DC #5].\n\n### Laboratory and Surveillance Networks\n\nLaboratory systems and networks are underdeveloped, with low diagnostic capacity for emerging threats. For instance, only 1.3% of microbiology laboratories in 14 member states can test for key antimicrobial resistance pathogens, signifying a widespread deficit in biosurveillance ability. However, initiatives like the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative and expansion of genomic testing labs from 7 to 40 across the continent illustrate efforts to build laboratory capacity, which are crucial for timely detection and risk assessment of diseases [E #2, #24, #36; R #56, #74].\n\n### Human Resources and Expertise\n\nThere is a shortage of skilled professionals to effectively manage biosafety and disease control. Capacity building activities such as joint training, simulation exercises, and learning exchanges are underway to enhance workforce skills. Despite these, structural problems like “ghost workers,” absenteeism, and migration reduce the effectiveness of available personnel and threaten the sustainability of health systems [E #4, #18, #28; R #20].\n\n### Cross-Border Cooperation\n\nDiseases like mpox highlight the need for coordinated cross-border collaboration. However, challenges persist in real-time data sharing, joint planning, and harmonized response mechanisms due to varying levels of preparedness, governance, and political will among countries. Movement of people, animals, and goods across borders facilitates disease spread, complicating containment measures [E #1, #55, #62; R #34, #22].\n\n---\n\n### Common and Unique Challenges Across Nigeria, Uganda, and Chad\n\n- **Common Challenges:** All three countries face systemic underfunding; limited laboratory and diagnostic infrastructure; regulatory and governance fragmentation; shortages of skilled health workers; and difficulties in cross-border coordination that hamper efficient outbreak response and biosafety measures.\n\n- **Unique Challenges:** Variations arise from each nation's political stability, health system governance, and capacity to implement regional frameworks. For example, countries with more developed regulatory authorities and better integration into regional networks likely face fewer delays in regulatory approval and better data exchange. Conversely, countries with more fragile governance or conflict settings may struggle more with implementing coherent biosafety policies or mobilizing adequate funding.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Impact on Systemic Risk\n\nThese structural deficiencies contribute to prolonged vulnerabilities in biosafety and disease control systems, increasing risk for widespread epidemics and limiting Africa’s ability to respond to emerging health threats effectively. Fragmented regulatory environments and under-resourced health workforces impede rapid containment of outbreaks, while limited cross-border coordination allows diseases to spread regionally and internationally, posing risks to global health security. Without robust investment in governance, legal frameworks, funding, laboratory capacity, human resources, and regional cooperation, systemic risks will likely persist or escalate, undermining both continental and global health security objectives [E #6, #9, #10, #33, #38, #45; R #37].\n\n---\n\nThese insights emphasize the importance of sustained multi-sectoral investments and harmonized strategies to overcome both common and country-specific structural barriers, thereby reducing long-term systemic health risks in Nigeria, Uganda, Chad, and similar contexts across Africa.\n\n[DC #1, #2, #4, #5, #6; E #3, #4, #8, #24, #28, #29; R #20, #22, #34, #37, #42, #56, #62]",

    "return": "### Core Capacity Bottlenecks in AMR Monitoring and Response in Africa\n\nSeveral critical capacity bottlenecks continue to challenge effective management of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Africa, particularly concerning surveillance, vaccine and medicine accessibility, laboratory testing, and emergency supply chain logistics:\n\n1. **Limited Laboratory Diagnostic Capacity**  \n   The ability to detect key AMR pathogens remains extremely low. A study by Africa CDC and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine revealed that only about 1.3% of microbiology laboratories in 14 Africa CDC member states can test for priority AMR pathogens. This severely restricts effective AMR surveillance and the generation of data needed to guide treatment protocols and policy [DC #1; R #5, #66, #31].\n\n2. **Underfunding and Resource Constraints**  \n   Despite the urgent need for a comprehensive AMR response, current funding in Africa is less than one-tenth of what is allocated to other major infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The estimated annual funding need is USD 2-6 billion, but existing resources fall short. This funding gap hampers scaling of diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective AMR monitoring programs [DC #1; R #61].\n\n3. **Vaccine and Antimicrobial Accessibility Issues**  \n   There is insufficient availability and distribution of high-quality vaccines, diagnostics, and antimicrobials targeting high-priority pathogens in risk-prone African contexts. This limitation extends to emergency medical countermeasures and vaccines essential for outbreak response and routine immunization, constraining Africa's ability to respond swiftly to disease threats [DC #1; R #4, #13, #40].\n\n4. **Emergency Supply Chain and Stockpiling Challenges**  \n   Emergency preparedness is hindered by limitations in supply chain optimization and stockpiling capabilities. Although initiatives like the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) are prioritizing establishing sub-regional hubs for emergency supplies, ongoing deficiencies in logistics delay the rapid deployment of needed medical products during outbreaks, undermining timely responses [DC #4, #8; R #14, #17, #22].\n\n### Consequences for Public Health Security and Socioeconomic Resilience\n\nThese bottlenecks have both direct and systemic repercussions for Africa’s public health and broader regional development:\n\n- **Increased Morbidity and Mortality**  \n  Africa faces the highest mortality rate from AMR globally, with 27.3 deaths per 100,000 population, exceeding deaths from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. Vulnerable populations, particularly children, bear a disproportionate burden of disease failure due to resistant infections [DC #1; R #1, #4, #33].\n\n- **Escalating Economic and Livelihood Threats**  \n  AMR undermines agrifood systems, food safety, and security, threatening livelihoods and economies broadly. Projections estimate global healthcare costs exceeding USD 1 trillion annually by 2050, along with significant declines in livestock production, directly affecting food and economic security in Africa [DC #1; R #27, #63].\n\n- **Barrier to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Africa’s Agenda 2063**  \n  The scale and complexity of AMR hamper progress toward crucial development ambitions, including the SDGs and the African Union’s long-term socio-economic vision (Agenda 2063), by straining health systems and curtailing human capital productivity [DC #1; R #61, #62].\n\n- **Fragile Emergency Response and Outbreak Control**  \n  Deficiencies in diagnostics and rapid vaccine deployment weaken Africa's ability to detect and curtail infectious disease outbreaks, prolonging epidemics and increasing transmission risks. This fragility compromises the continent’s health security and regional stability, with cascading negative effects on trade, travel, and governance [DC #4, #8; R #42, #15].\n\nIn summary, without significant and sustained investments to expand diagnostic laboratory capacity, ensure reliable vaccine and antimicrobial access, and optimize emergency logistics, Africa's public health safety nets remain vulnerable. These systemic limitations threaten to exacerbate disease burdens and undermine socio-economic resilience across the continent [DC #1, #4, #8; R #31, #66, #42].\n\n---\n\nThis analysis is based on reports and partnership initiatives led by Africa CDC, WHO, African Society for Laboratory Medicine, and associated entities dedicated to enhancing surveillance, preparedness, and response to antimicrobial resistance and emergent health threats in Africa.",

    "return": "### Policy Support, Governance Mechanisms, and Capacity Foundations for Building a Resilient Biosafety System in Africa by 2030\n\nTo build a resilient biosafety system across the African continent by 2030, critical areas requiring strengthening include:\n\n1. **Policy Support**  \n   Strengthening coordinated public health emergency preparedness and response is essential. This includes adopting comprehensive frameworks like the Africa CDC’s strategic plans aligned with the African Union Agenda 2063 and the Africa Health Strategy (2016-2030), which emphasize pandemic preparedness, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) management, and integrated health systems. These strategic frameworks provide a policy foundation to address health emergencies and promote sustainable health security ([E #1, #5, #8, #9]; [DC #2]).\n\n2. **Governance Mechanisms**  \n   Establishing strong collaboration and partnership frameworks is critical. Africa CDC’s collaborations with entities such as WHO (including the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan - JEAP), the European Union, UNICEF, and strategic agreements like the Memorandum of Cooperation with the U.S. government form the governance backbone that underpins continental health security efforts. These mechanisms promote integrated health system strengthening, harmonized regulatory processes (in collaboration with bodies like the African Medicines Agency), and pooled procurement systems for health commodities ([R #1, #4, #5, #6, #9, #14]; [DC #4, #5, #6]).\n\n3. **Capacity Foundations**  \n   Building and sustaining a robust health workforce, enhancing disease surveillance (including pathogen genomics), decentralizing diagnostics, and advancing local manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics are vital capacity pillars. Africa CDC leads initiatives such as the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA) aiming to produce 60% of vaccines locally by 2040, which strengthens resilience and self-reliance. Moreover, capacity building in laboratory infrastructure and regulatory expertise is integrated with partnerships involving regional bodies, WHO, and international organizations to ensure timely detection and response to emerging biological threats ([E #34, #46, #53]; [R #19, #20, #22]; [DC #1, #4, #5]).\n\n### Sino-African Cooperation for Complementarity and Mutual Benefit in Global Biosafety Governance and Capacity Community Building\n\nIn the context of strengthening global biosafety governance and creating capacity networks, Sino-African cooperation can focus on:\n\n1. **Leveraging Complementary Strengths**  \n   Africa’s urgent need for enhanced health system resilience and local manufacturing capabilities aligns well with China's expertise in infrastructure development, health technology, and manufacturing capacity. Joint efforts can facilitate technology transfer, capacity building, and support for sustainable health product local production lines in Africa. This synergy would expedite Africa's health sovereignty and contribute to global health security ([E #36, #44]; [R #3, #6]).\n\n2. **Enhancing Joint Rule-Making and Influence**  \n   Collaborative participation in international health diplomacy forums, supported by shared strategic frameworks such as those initiated by Africa CDC and global partners, can strengthen the representation and voice of Africa and China. By aligning approaches in health emergency preparedness, antimicrobial resistance mitigation, and vaccine policy, the partnership can influence international regulation, including updates to the International Health Regulations (IHR) and pandemic agreements slated for negotiation ([E #22, #43]; [DC #6]).\n\n3. **Building Sustained Capacity through Knowledge Sharing**  \n   Joint initiatives that enable knowledge exchange and joint research—covering pathogen genomics, vaccine R&D, and emergency response—will build durable foundations for mutual capability. The experience of institutions like Africa CDC in coordinating regional responses combined with China's advances in healthcare innovation will bolster a robust capacity community, positively impacting both African and global health landscapes ([R #1, #19, #20, #22]; [DC #8]).\n\n4. **Promoting Respectful Partnerships and Equity**  \n   Cooperation aligned with Africa CDC’s emphasis on the New Public Health Order calls for respectful partnerships grounded in African leadership and ownership. Fair and transparent collaboration frameworks that engage African governments and civil society ensure sustainable impact and mutual benefit while strengthening Africa's health security architecture ([E #9, #53]; [DC #4, #10]).\n\nIn summary, achieving resilient biosafety systems in Africa by 2030 depends on policy coherence, strong governance, and capacity building. Meanwhile, Sino-African partnerships offer significant potential to jointly shape global biosafety governance and enhance health security through complementary strengths and shared goals.\n\n[References: DC #1,2,4,5,6,8,10; E #1,5,8,9,22,34,36,43,44,46,53; R #1,3,4,5,6,9,14,19,20,22,43]",

    "return": "# Current Status of Biological Control Capabilities in Africa\n\n## Laboratory Testing Network and Disease Surveillance\n\nAfrica CDC supports a continent-wide network aimed at strengthening laboratory medicine and surveillance capacities through collaborations with organizations like the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) and member states across all regions including Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Africa. However, challenges remain, such as limited diagnostic capacity for antimicrobial resistance (AMR); for example, only 1.3% of microbiology laboratories in Africa CDC member states can test key AMR pathogens, indicating a significant capacity gap in laboratory diagnostics for AMR surveillance [E #20; R #59].\n\nDisease surveillance and intelligence are integral to detecting outbreaks and guiding timely responses. Africa CDC emphasizes pathogen genomic surveillance, supported by initiatives such as the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative and regional strategies, like Malawi's launch of its second edition Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan. These projects aim to enhance the continent’s capacity to detect emerging pathogens early and bolster outbreak response [E #2, #42; R #5, #13, #21, #29, #39].\n\n## Emergency Response Capabilities\n\nEmergency response and preparedness constitute a core thematic focus for Africa CDC, which operates across all regional zones: Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Africa. Africa CDC leads coordinated emergency response efforts, including outbreak response for diseases like Mpox, and collaborates with WHO and other partners through mechanisms such as the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP), launched recently to strengthen health system readiness and epidemic management [E #3, #10, #33; R #11, #44, #45].\n\nThe establishment of WHO Regional Emergency Hubs in Senegal (Dakar), Kenya (Nairobi), and South Africa (Pretoria) has further enhanced rapid and effective responses to health crises. These hubs focus on strategic pre-positioning of emergency health supplies, development of emergency medical personnel, research and genomic surveillance. Since the launch of these hubs, delivery times for critical medical supplies have decreased from approximately 45 days to 3 days, significantly improving response speed [DC #9].\n\n## Vaccine Accessibility and Coverage\n\nVaccine accessibility remains a challenge, as highlighted by UNICEF’s 2023 Vaccination Report which pointed to millions of under-vaccinated and zero-dose children across Africa. In response, Africa CDC is actively leading initiatives to boost local vaccine manufacturing capacity through the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), aiming for 60% local vaccine production by 2040 to reduce external dependence and improve accessibility [E #29, #48; R #48].\n\nAdditionally, Africa CDC supports member states like Uganda and Zambia with cold chain equipment to improve vaccine storage and distribution infrastructure, contributing to better immunization program coverage [E #34, #45; R #20, #64, #69]. Strengthening immunization systems is recognized as vital to reducing outbreaks and epidemics continent-wide [R #40].\n\n## Regional and Country-Level Differences\n\nSignificant disparities exist between regions and countries. For instance:\n\n- **Eastern Africa** has a dual focus on AMR surveillance and disease intelligence and is a primary target region for elimination frameworks for diseases like visceral leishmaniasis, accounting for 73% of global cases in 2022. It also participates actively in genomic surveillance and outbreak preparedness efforts [E #11; R #2, #36].\n\n- **Central Africa** is notably affected by ongoing Mpox epidemics, requiring coordinated regional responses involving enhanced surveillance and cross-border collaboration. This region also participates in major AU-EU health partnership programs and pathogen genomics activities [E #26; R #3, #37].\n\n- **Northern Africa** plays a significant role in health emergency preparedness and antimicrobial resistance monitoring but may face different challenges compared to regions with high outbreak burdens. It is actively involved in regional health initiatives and pathogen genomic activities [E #30; R #6].\n\n- **Southern Africa** shares focus with other regions in health emergency and outbreak response, including participating in regional medical supplies distributions and genomic surveillance efforts [E #14; R #61].\n\n- **Western Africa** also forms part of Africa CDC’s jurisdiction and benefits from the continental strategies in diagnostics decentralization and outbreak preparedness [E #19; R #62].\n\nCountries like Malawi have advanced their pathogen genomic surveillance strategies, reflecting country-level leadership aligned with Africa CDC’s continental initiatives, while others may still be building laboratory and surveillance capacities.\n\nIn summary, while significant efforts have strengthened Africa's biological control capabilities, challenges such as laboratory diagnostic capacity, vaccine coverage, and uneven regional resource distribution persist. Continued investment and coordination under Africa CDC and partners seek to address these disparities to enhance Africa’s health security and epidemic preparedness [DC #4, #5, #6, #7; E #17, #27, #37, #60; R #18, #27, #30, #31].\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you need detailed data or specific country comparisons.",

    "return": "### Interaction of Systemic Challenges Affecting Biosafety Capacity in Africa\n\nIn the short and medium term, the enhancement of Africa's biosafety capacity is significantly influenced by the interplay among fiscal investment, health workforce, and governance structures. Insufficient and inefficient financial allocation limits the resources available to strengthen public health infrastructure, including biosafety measures. This underinvestment is compounded by critical shortages and management inefficiencies within the health workforce, such as ghost workers, absenteeism, and suboptimal performance, which collectively reduce system efficiency—African health systems operate at only 77% efficiency, losing about 20% of health spending due to these inefficiencies [E #4, #39; R #40; DC #4].\n\nMoreover, governance challenges related to ownership, managerial skills, and national leadership capacity further constrain the effective deployment of available resources, obstructing sustained improvements in biosafety. The establishment of strong leadership and accountable governance frameworks is essential to facilitate coordinated actions and optimize resource use [E #2; R #25].\n\n### Mechanisms Behind These Interactions\n\nThe limited fiscal investment constrains recruitment, training, and retention of healthcare workers, thereby exacerbating workforce shortages and low performance. These workforce challenges impair the health system’s ability to enforce biosafety protocols and respond effectively to public health threats. Poor governance and weak managerial skills further hinder planning, budgeting, and implementation of biosafety-related interventions, creating a cycle that perpetuates systemic weaknesses.\n\n### Paths to Sustainable Improvement\n\n1. **Increased and Smarter Investments:** There is a need for continent-wide increases in GDP expenditure on health by up to 1.5%, with more than half specifically earmarked for health workforce investments, particularly in rural and primary healthcare settings [DC #4]. Such investments should be coupled with mechanisms to improve efficiency and transparency in spending.\n\n2. **Strengthening Health Workforce:** The African Health Workforce Investment Charter aims to mobilize and align domestic and partner funding to grow, retain, and better manage the health workforce, targeting skill-building and incentivization to reduce migration and absenteeism [E #4; R #39, #64; DC #4]. Investment returns on health workforce are high, with potential economic returns up to nine times the invested amount, contributing additionally to economic growth and social empowerment, especially for women and youth [E #7, #12, #35; R #39, #63, #71, #72].\n\n3. **Enhancing Governance and Managerial Capacity:** Developing managerial skills and fostering strong country leadership and ownership are critical for sustaining health system gains. Initiatives under the Team Europe Initiative on Manufacturing and Access to Vaccines, Medicines, and Health Technologies (TEI MAV+) emphasize these aspects as foundational for local health manufacturing and biosafety improvements [E #2; R #25].\n\n4. **Regional and Continental Partnerships:** Collaboration between Africa CDC, African Union bodies, and international partners such as WHO and the European Union facilitate coordinated governance frameworks, regulatory harmonization, and resource mobilization that underpin sustainable biosafety capacity strengthening [E #1, #6, #10, #44, #48; R #3, #6, #10, #15].\n\n5. **Holistic Approaches and Frameworks:** Efforts toward a New Public Health Order and strategic frameworks like 'One Plan, One Budget, and One M&E Framework' support unified planning, budgeting, and monitoring that enhance governance and resource optimization [E #17, #21; R #37]. Enabling social protection systems that incorporate health coverage and income security further stabilize public health safety nets [E #40].\n\nIn summary, addressing these overlapping constraints requires integrated strategies combining increased and efficient funding, robust health workforce development, and strengthened governance supported by regional collaboration and international partnerships. Through these pathways, Africa can achieve sustainable improvements in biosafety capacity to better manage health security risks [DC #1, #2, #4; E #2, #4, #6, #7, #39; R #25, #39, #40].",

    "return": "### Key Innovative and Breakthrough Measures Since September 2023\n\nFrom September 2023 onwards, African countries have undertaken several innovative and breakthrough initiatives to enhance their public health emergency management systems and biosafety capacities. These efforts are aligned with strengthening emergency preparedness, response capabilities, and cross-border collaboration, primarily coordinated under the leadership of Africa CDC and in partnership with WHO and other key stakeholders.\n\n1. **Establishment and Coordination of the Africa Taskforce for Mpox Coordination**  \n   Member States have formed the Africa Taskforce for Mpox Coordination to facilitate strengthening preparedness and response capacities for mpox and similar outbreaks. This includes rapid epidemic response, enhanced surveillance, national laboratory capacity building, and community engagement. The taskforce also implements a common regional and national roadmap for mpox prevention, detection, and control, emphasizing evidence-based decision-making through prioritized scientific research [DC #1].\n\n2. **Capacity Building and Workforce Enhancement**  \n   Capacity building initiatives encompass joint training, learning exchanges, benchmarking visits, and simulation exercises for human resources and national laboratories. These measures directly address gaps in skilled personnel and laboratory diagnostic capabilities, enabling faster and more effective outbreak detection and response [DC #1; R #21].\n\n3. **Cross-Border Collaboration for Coordinated Response**  \n   Countries have strengthened cross-border collaboration mechanisms, including real-time sharing and digitization of epidemiological and laboratory data, joint planning and implementation of preparedness and response activities, resource and technical expertise sharing, and coordinated risk communication and community engagement. Such concerted efforts at multiple governance levels promote cohesive epidemic control across neighboring states [DC #10; R #3, #32, #35, #54].\n\n4. **Development of Legal and Logistical Frameworks for Rapid Deployment**  \n   Legal and regulatory processes have been developed to enable rapid cross-border deployment of public health experts and medical personnel, addressing critical delays during outbreak responses and enhancing operational readiness across countries [DC #1].\n\n5. **Strengthening Genomic Surveillance and Diagnostic Decentralization**  \n   Africa CDC, in collaboration with WHO and partners, has advanced pathogen genomic surveillance capabilities and decentralized diagnostics across regions. The integration of genomic sequencing with surveillance intelligence facilitates quicker outbreak detection, enhancing adaptive response strategies [DC #2, #8; R #27, #63].\n\n6. **Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP)**  \n   The JEAP, co-led by Africa CDC and WHO, is a five-year strategic partnership focused on reinforcing emergency preparedness and response systems across Africa. JEAP targets critical areas such as stockpiling emergency supplies, deploying first responders swiftly, and optimizing supply chains to reduce delivery delays from 20 days to 24-48 hours. It also promotes partnerships with UNICEF and other organizations to strengthen health systems and immunization programs [DC #4, #7, #8; R #1, #20, #23].\n\n### Addressing Regional and National Gaps\n\nThese measures directly respond to the region’s and countries’ key shortcomings such as limited laboratory diagnostic capacity, inadequate surveillance systems, insufficient trained workforce, and fractured cross-border emergency coordination. By focusing on capacity building, integrated surveillance through genomic sequencing, and establishing regional taskforces, African countries have improved the speed, accuracy, and coordination of public health emergency responses.\n\n### Replicable and Sustainable Mechanisms\n\n- **Multisectoral and Multinational Collaboration Frameworks**  \n  The Africa Taskforce for Mpox Coordination represents a replicable model for taskforces targeting other infectious diseases, emphasizing multisectoral coordination, accountable national plans, and inclusive community-centered responses [DC #10].\n\n- **Cross-Border Data Sharing and Joint Planning**  \n  The formalization of data sharing, joint planning, and resource mobilization agreements among neighboring countries fosters sustainable regional epidemic responses and establishes a blueprint for future outbreaks [DC #10; R #32].\n\n- **Strategic Partnerships and Frameworks**  \n  The JEAP defines a collaborative, strategic approach combining resources from Africa CDC, WHO, UNICEF, and other partners, which can be adapted for other emergency health threats, ensuring sustained capacity development and system strengthening [DC #4, #7, #8; R #1, #20].\n\n- **Capacity Building through Joint Exercises and Workforce Training**  \n  Standardized training and simulated outbreak responses enhance preparedness and facilitate knowledge transfer, applicable across different countries and emergencies [DC #1; R #21].\n\nIn summary, since September 2023, African countries have made significant strides in public health emergency preparedness and biosafety by implementing innovative collaborative taskforces, enhancing workforce capacity, strengthening genomic surveillance, and bolstering cross-border coordination. These measures fill critical operational gaps and represent adaptable and sustainable frameworks for continued health security advancements across the continent.\n\n[DC 1, 4, 7, 8, 10; R 1, 3, 20, 21, 23, 27, 32, 35, 54]",

    "return": "### Post-Pandemic Global Health Governance and Its Impact on Africa's Biosafety Governance\n\nIn the post-pandemic era, global health governance systems, including reforms within the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccine sovereignty efforts, and advancements in digital health and data sovereignty, are collectively reshaping Africa's biosafety governance structure. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is centrally involved in these transformations. Africa CDC collaborates closely with WHO and other global partners to enhance health emergency preparedness, surveillance, and response capacities across the continent through initiatives like the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP). This strategic collaboration reflects a commitment to strengthen institutional capacities and improve continental resilience against health threats, including emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [DC #1; E #7, #4; R #1].\n\nOne significant dimension of this reshaping is the push for African health sovereignty, which involves increasing local manufacturing of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics to reduce dependence on external sources. Africa CDC leads initiatives such as the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), emphasizing the goal to produce 60% of vaccines locally by 2040, underpinned by strategic partnerships with entities like Gavi and the EU. Enhanced regulatory harmonization, through cooperation with bodies such as the African Medicines Agency (AMA) and coordination with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), supports this drive for sovereignty by facilitating access to quality and affordable health products [E #2, #7, #46, #47; DC #1, #8; R #9, #13, #47].\n\nDigital health and data sovereignty are also gaining prominence. Efforts include adopting innovative digital technologies to improve health product access and adoption of precision public health metrics to support evidence-based interventions. These approaches empower African nations to utilize their data fully in decision-making, thus enhancing epidemic detection, risk assessment, and intervention effectiveness [E #11, #34; DC #2; R #11].\n\n### Key Measures for African Countries to Enhance Governance Adaptability, Risk Assessment, and Emergency Management\n\nFacing complex and shifting international landscapes, African countries should embrace several critical measures to modernize their health governance systems:\n\n1. **Strengthening Institutional Capacities:** Building robust public health institutions and workforce capabilities is fundamental. Strategic partnerships, like that between Africa CDC and the Africa Public Health Foundation (APHF), prioritize institutional strengthening, resource mobilization, and policy advocacy in alignment with Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order framework [DC #3; E #3, #4; R #46].\n\n2. **Enhancing Surveillance and Disease Intelligence:** Investing in pathogen genomic surveillance and molecular diagnostics ensures timely detection and response to health threats. Africa CDC’s collaborations with regional emergency hubs and international partners facilitate these capacities, enabling swift epidemic containment and mitigation [E #41, #45; R #20, #63].\n\n3. **Promoting Local Manufacturing and Regulatory Harmonization:** Expanding local manufacturing capacity reduces reliance on global supply chains, mitigates shortages, and supports rapid emergency vaccine responses. This requires harmonized regulatory frameworks, expedited WHO prequalification processes, and active collaboration with continental regulatory bodies like AMA [DC #8; E #46; R #9].\n\n4. **Adopting Digital Health and Data Analytics:** Leveraging digital technologies and precision public health metrics enables better risk assessments and policy planning. African countries need to strengthen data governance and sovereignty to ensure effective use of health data in decision-making [E #11, #34].\n\n5. **Reinforcing Emergency Preparedness and Response Mechanisms:** Countries should enhance their rapid response capabilities through coordinated surveillance, stockpiling supplies, and trained health workforce ready for deployment, following frameworks exemplified by JEAP and guidance from regional WHO emergency hubs established post-COVID-19 [E #42, #45, #48; DC #10; R #1, #31].\n\n6. **Engaging in International and Regional Partnerships:** Active collaboration with multilateral organizations such as WHO, the African Union, the European Union, and donors like the UK government is crucial. Such partnerships bring technical expertise, financing, and support for initiatives covering pandemic preparedness, vaccine development, and health system strengthening [DC #2, #6; E #17, #44; R #5, #6, #55].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reshaping of Africa's biosafety governance in the post-pandemic era hinges on strengthened regional leadership, enhanced collaboration with global health partners, and holistic health system modernization. African countries' proactive adoption of institutional strengthening, surveillance, local manufacturing, digital health innovation, and emergency preparedness will be vital. These efforts underpin sustainable health sovereignty and resilience, enabling the continent to navigate emergent health challenges and evolving international dynamics effectively.\n\n[DC #1, #2, #3, #6, #7, #8, #10; E #2, #3, #4, #7, #11, #17, #34, #41, #42, #44, #45, #46, #47; R #1, #5, #6, #9, #13, #20, #31, #46, #47, #55]",

    "return": "### Current Biosafety Situation in Africa\n\nAfrica faces significant biosafety challenges, particularly with ongoing and emerging infectious disease outbreaks. These include high-mortality diseases such as antimicrobial-resistant infections, mpox (monkeypox) epidemics, and other contagious diseases presenting recurring threats across the continent. Africa has the highest mortality rates due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), exceeding deaths from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. Vulnerable populations, including children, are disproportionately affected by these threats. Recent data highlights under-capacities in antimicrobial resistance surveillance, with only about 1.3% of microbiology laboratories in 14 member states capable of testing for critical AMR pathogens, underscoring the urgent need to bolster diagnostic infrastructure [DC #10; E #9, #21, #25, #46, #58].\n\n### Major Infectious Disease Trends\n\nThere is a prolonged and ongoing epidemic of mpox primarily affecting Central and West Africa. Mpox presents a high transmission risk with severe social and economic impacts and has been declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security. The outbreaks have led African health ministers from several countries (including Angola, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda, among others) to convene emergency meetings emphasizing cross-border collaboration, information sharing, and One Health approaches to control and contain the epidemic. Challenges such as insufficient response capacities and vaccine shortages remain critical roadblocks [E #55, #69; R #27, #29, #32, #33, #41, #53].\n\n### Biosafety and Biosecurity Capacities\n\nAfrica CDC continues to strengthen biosafety capacities through multiple initiatives. These include advancing molecular diagnostics, genomic surveillance strategies, and supporting laboratory system improvements to detect and respond to outbreaks effectively. The Africa CDC Institute for Pathogen Genomics plays a central role in implementing pathogen genomics and outbreak response systems, facilitated through partnerships with regional lab networks and international organizations like the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) [E #17, #59; R #59, #62].\n\nAfrica CDC is also leading continent-wide strategies to decentralize diagnostics and accelerate outbreak responses, which improve timely detection and containment of infectious threats. Vaccine cold chain infrastructure has been enhanced in several member states (e.g., Botswana, Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Zambia) with support from partners like UNICEF and the Mastercard Foundation, expanding vaccination coverage and immunization service delivery across the continent [E #1, #8, #21; DC #8, #9].\n\n### Key Institutions and International Collaboration\n\nAfrica CDC is the premier technical public health agency of the African Union, tasked with supporting member states in disease surveillance, outbreak response, and health system strengthening. It operates within the African Union framework and collaborates extensively with international partners such as WHO, UNICEF, the US CDC, CEPI, the European Commission Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), and the European Union.\n\nNotable collaborative mechanisms include:\n- The Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) jointly launched by Africa CDC and WHO to bolster emergency response systems continent-wide.\n- Strategic partnerships with the United Kingdom government to address epidemics, drug-resistant infections, and climate-health challenges with significant investments.\n- The Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative, co-funded by the European Union, targets enhanced pathogen surveillance capacity.\n- Regional coordination through ministerial meetings and task forces for mpox response, emphasizing multi-sectoral and community-centered One Health approaches [E #5, #6, #47, #52; R #2, #3, #6, #44, #45, #54].\n\n### Data and Progress Indicators\n\n- Africa CDC publishes recurring Africa CDC Weekly Briefs, providing timely updates on health emergencies, genomic surveillance, and response activities across regions (Central, Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Africa).\n- Expanded immunization initiatives aim to reduce outbreaks and increase vaccine accessibility with UNICEF collaboration and pooled procurement mechanisms.\n- The African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA) was launched to increase local vaccine production, aiming to meet 60% of vaccine needs by 2040.\n- Strengthened cold chain equipment capabilities and improved diagnostic networks are already active in multiple member states.\n- Ongoing reports such as the Africa CDC’s landmark AMR report inform global meetings including the United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting, signaling growing recognition and prioritization of these biosafety challenges [E #1, #6, #10, #12, #48; R #9, #11, #12, #52].\n\n---\n\nIn summary, Africa’s current biosafety landscape is marked by persistent infectious disease threats, notably AMR and mpox, alongside efforts to build core capacities in diagnostics, surveillance, and response. Africa CDC stands as a crucial institution driving continent-wide coordination and international cooperation to enhance biosafety and health security across Africa.\n\n[DC #1, #2, #8, #9, #10; E #5, #6, #9, #17, #21, #25, #46, #47, #48, #55; R #2, #3, #6, #9, #27, #29, #32, #44, #45, #53]",

    "return": "# Overview of Major Biosafety Risks Facing Africa\n\nAfrica currently confronts multiple significant biosafety risks that affect public health security. These risks span infectious disease outbreaks, rising antimicrobial resistance, gaps in public health coverage, challenges in vaccine accessibility, laboratory biosafety concerns, and zoonotic threats originating from animal and plant sources. Below is a categorized summary of these risks with reference to recent authoritative data and practical examples since September 2023.\n\n## Infectious Disease Outbreaks\n\nAfrica experiences frequent outbreaks and epidemics across diverse regions, making disease outbreaks a critical biosafety risk. The continent faces over 130 disease outbreaks annually, representing the highest global burden of health emergencies. Infectious diseases such as mpox (monkeypox), Ebola, Marburg virus, cholera, visceral leishmaniasis, and emerging pathogens remain persistent threats.\n\n- **Mpox (monkeypox)** is endemic in 12 African countries mainly in Central and West Africa, with recurrent episodes since 2022 leading to rising case numbers and deaths. High transmissibility, significant morbidity, and social-economic disruption characterize this epidemic. Challenges include limited vaccine supply, insufficient public and health worker awareness, and cross-border movement facilitating spread—especially notable in Central and Eastern Africa [E #28, R #41, #52, #53].\n\n- Other diseases like visceral leishmaniasis disproportionately impact **Eastern Africa**, which recorded about 73% of global cases in 2022, prompting targeted elimination efforts [E #57].\n\n- Outbreak response coordination is led by Africa CDC with support from WHO and international partners, further supplemented by genomic surveillance initiatives to enhance early detection and management [E #4, #41; R #69, #70].\n\n## Rising Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) has surged as a major biosafety threat, surpassing mortality from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in Africa. AMR involves microbes developing resistance to antimicrobial drugs, leading to treatment failures, increased transmission, and heightened mortality—especially among children and vulnerable groups.\n\n- AMR surveillance and disease intelligence are active across **Central, Eastern, Southern, and Western Africa**, coordinated by African public health bodies and supported by organizations like African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) [E #22, #56; R #24, #26, #28, #29, #31].\n\n- Beyond health, AMR threatens agrifood systems, food safety, security, livelihoods, and economies, a multidimensional impact emphasized by AU-IBAR leadership [R #30, #35].\n\n- Laboratory capacity remains limited, with only 1.3% of microbiology labs capable of testing key AMR pathogens, impeding effective surveillance and containment [R #31].\n\n## Public Health System Coverage Insufficiency\n\nA key biosafety risk derives from inadequate public health infrastructure and service coverage:\n\n- Many African regions have fragile primary healthcare systems, exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, that hinder effective outbreak preparedness and response.\n\n- Community health workers and frontline services remain under-resourced, limiting immunization reach and early disease detection [E #1].\n\n- Health system strengthening is a major priority, with Africa CDC expanding partnerships to optimize supply chain management, pooled procurement, emergency preparedness, and health worker capacity [E #1, R #10].\n\n## Vaccine Accessibility and Manufacturing Challenges\n\nAfrica imports 99% of its vaccines and 70-90% of medicines and medical devices, creating dependency and vulnerability:\n\n- The African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA) initiative launched in June 2024 aims to support local manufacturers with financial incentives to scale up production sustainably, motivated by vaccine inequity experienced during COVID-19 [E #58, #31; R #27, #25].\n\n- Africa CDC and CEPI partnership enhances vaccine R&D, clinical trial readiness, manufacturing capacity, and safety protocols to boost vaccine sovereignty with a target to produce 60% of Africa’s vaccine needs locally by 2040 [E #5; R #11, #13, #14, #15].\n\n- Vaccine shortages, particularly for mpox, hamper outbreak containment efforts [E #26; R #40].\n\n## Laboratory Biosafety Incidents\n\nThough direct lab biosafety events are less detailed in the recent records, laboratory capacities crucial for pathogen genomic surveillance and diagnostics are being expanded:\n\n- Africa CDC’s initiatives include advancing molecular diagnostics and genomic surveillance with support from partners like WHO, European Union, HERA, and local institutions to improve detection, reporting, and data sharing [E #23, #41, #42; R #1, #69, #70].\n\n- Coordination with African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) aims to enhance routine molecular diagnostics integration and laboratory strengthening continent-wide [E #23; R #56].\n\n## Zoonotic and Agricultural Threats\n\nAnimal and plant source diseases and biosafety risks are recognized within integrated “One Health” approaches:\n\n- Zoonotic diseases like mpox and visceral leishmaniasis illustrate the spillover risks affecting human populations.\n\n- AMR also poses threats to agrifood systems and animal health, placing food security and livelihoods at risk, amplifying biosafety concerns beyond human health alone [E #22; R #35].\n\n## Regional and National Variations\n\n- **Central and Western Africa** are focal regions for mpox outbreaks, vaccine shortages, and genomic surveillance efforts.\n\n- **Eastern Africa** faces dual challenges from mpox and visceral leishmaniasis, alongside frontline involvement in humanitarian crisis responses.\n\n- **Southern Africa** is engaged in AMR surveillance and benefits from health security initiatives supported by international collaborations.\n\n- **Northern Africa** participates in regional pathogen genomics and health system strengthening projects organized by Africa CDC.\n\nOverall, while all African regions confront biosafety risks, variations in disease prevalence, health system capacity, and intervention readiness create different exposure and vulnerability profiles.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe biosafety landscape in Africa is complex and multifaceted, spanning infectious disease outbreaks like mpox, escalating antimicrobial resistance threatening multiple sectors, systemic public health capability gaps, limited vaccine access, and ongoing efforts to strengthen laboratory biosafety capacities and One Health responses. Africa CDC, in collaboration with international and regional partners, leads coordinated multisectoral strategies to address these risks, aiming to build resilient health systems, expand local manufacturing, and enhance surveillance to better protect health security across the continent.\n\n[DC #1, #3, #5, #8, #9; E #15, #22, #28, #41, #58; R #7, #22, #27, #40, #52, #56]",

    "return": "# Analysis of Core Structural Challenges in Biosafety in Africa\n\nBiosafety in Africa faces multifaceted structural challenges that hinder effective disease control, outbreak response, and health security. Based on available knowledge, these challenges can be systematically analyzed across six dimensions: governance system deficiencies, insufficient regional and cross-border collaboration, laboratory and data infrastructure weaknesses, regulatory and policy enforcement gaps, funding and human resource shortages, and socio-economic structural impacts. Case examples from countries like Nigeria, Chad, and Uganda illustrate the systemic and compound nature of these difficulties.\n\n## 1. Governance System Deficiencies\n\nAfrica’s biosafety governance is often fragmented with weak coordination across health sectors and limited integration of multi-sectoral stakeholders. The existence of overlapping responsibilities between institutions reduces efficiency in epidemic preparedness and response. For example, despite the establishment of continental institutions such as Africa CDC to coordinate health security efforts, national-level governance struggles with aligning policies and institutional mandates. This system fragmentation perpetuates slow decision-making and suboptimal crisis management.\n\nMoreover, inefficiencies in health workforce management, including problems like ghost workers and absenteeism, contribute to substantial loss of resources and diminished health system performance [DC #3, #5; R #40].\n\n## 2. Insufficient Regional and Cross-Border Collaboration\n\nCross-border population movement aggravates disease spread, such as Mpox, posing significant challenges to containment that require coordinated regional response. Africa’s disease surveillance and outbreak containment are often hampered by inadequate information sharing and collaboration among neighboring countries [E #40; R #20].\n\nWhile regional and continental initiatives exist, such as the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative and partnerships under Africa CDC, implementation at border regions remains weak. The lack of harmonized approaches in surveillance, diagnostics, and emergency response capabilities across countries is a persistent bottleneck.\n\n## 3. Laboratory and Data Infrastructure Shortcomings\n\nA major limitation in Africa’s biosafety capacity is the insufficient laboratory network and diagnostic capabilities. Only a small fraction of microbiology laboratories in member states can perform critical testing for pathogens related to antimicrobial resistance [R #30, #38].\n\nAdditionally, sustainable local diagnostic and research infrastructure for diseases like Mpox is lacking, with heavy dependence on external labs and partners. This insufficiency undermines timely outbreak detection and response and cripples research capacity [DC #1; R #19]. Data systems for surveillance and analytics are still developing but remain below needed standards for precision public health decision-making [DC #6].\n\n## 4. Regulatory Framework and Policy Enforcement Challenges\n\nThe continent faces cumbersome and fragmented regulatory approval pathways for vaccines and health products, which delay access and frustrate local manufacturing efforts [R #39]. Coordination between continent-wide regulatory bodies such as the African Medicines Agency and regional initiatives is still evolving [R #8, #37].\n\nMoreover, policies designed to improve biosafety and health security lack effective enforcement due to institutional weaknesses at country levels, limiting impact on disease control and prevention.\n\n## 5. Funding and Human Resource Constraints\n\nAfrica experiences critical shortages in funding dedicated to health security and biosafety, compounded by dire human resource gaps. The continent faces a severe health workforce shortage that undermines service delivery and emergency response [DC #3, #5; R #40].\n\nInvestment in workforce capacity building, retention, and smart deployment remains inadequate, with excessive migration and poor working conditions exacerbating shortages. Financial inefficiencies and underinvestment contribute to the fragility of health systems [DC #3].\n\n## 6. Socio-Economic Structural Impacts\n\nBroader socio-economic conditions, including poverty, unemployment, and social inequalities, limit the capacity for effective biosafety interventions. These factors influence health-seeking behavior, compliance with disease control measures, and access to healthcare.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR), a biosafety and health security concern, is intricately linked to food safety, agriculture, and livelihoods, compounding socio-economic vulnerabilities across regions [E #48, #51; R #35].\n\n## Case Examples: Nigeria, Chad, Uganda\n\n- **Nigeria:** Represents a country grappling with challenges in research capacity and diagnostic infrastructure, as exemplified in Mpox research consortium participation where institutions like Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital are involved [E #1, #39; DC #1]. Governance and workforce shortages mirror continental trends.\n\n- **Chad and Uganda:** While specifics are limited in the provided data, these countries are understood to face similar obstacles in laboratory capacity, data systems, and regional cooperation within broader Central and Eastern African contexts [E #1, #44].\n\n## Systemic and Compound Challenges Difficult to Resolve Short-Term\n\nAmong the challenges, the following are especially systemic, tend to reinforce each other, and lack quick solutions:\n\n- **Governance and policy enforcement weaknesses:** Deeply embedded institutional limitations and inefficiencies require long-term reforms.\n\n- **Laboratory and data infrastructure deficits:** Building sustainable, decentralized capacity is a multi-year endeavor reliant on sustained investment.\n\n- **Human resource shortages and migration:** Health workforce strengthening involves complex socio-economic factors and training pipelines that take years to mature.\n\n- **Fragmented regional coordination:** Political, logistical, and resource disparities across countries complicate harmonization and joint action.\n\nTogether, these compound issues create layered vulnerabilities to biosafety threats and impede emergency preparedness and response, underscoring the need for integrated, multi-sectoral, and sustained efforts across African health systems.\n\n---\n\nThis overview synthesizes available knowledge from the Africa CDC and partners’ reports and research consortium documents without extrapolation beyond the provided information [DC #1, #3, #6, #7; E #1, #39, #48; R #20, #30, #38, #39, #40].",
