            "description": "Africa CDC (Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention) is the specialized, continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union dedicated to strengthening health institutions and capacities across Africa. Its primary mission is to enhance disease surveillance, outbreak response, and emergency preparedness to detect, prevent, control, and manage health threats throughout the continent. As a leading public health institution in Africa, Africa CDC plays a central role in building health security and coordinating regional responses to infectious disease epidemics, including mpox, by collaborating closely with African governments and global partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union, and Gavi.\n\nAfrica CDC actively co-leads initiatives like the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to address disease outbreaks and public health emergencies, while providing technical support, capacity building, and epidemic response coordination. The agency emphasizes genomic surveillance strategies as part of its comprehensive approach to managing public health challenges and strengthening health systems continent-wide.\n\nIn addition to its role in disease control, Africa CDC leads and supports critical vaccine manufacturing initiatives, including the African Vaccine Manufacturing Alliance (AVMA), with the goal of increasing local production to meet 60% of Africa’s demand for vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics by 2040. The agency promotes sustainable vaccine development, regulatory harmonization, decentralization of diagnostics, and localization of health product manufacturing to build resilient and self-sufficient health systems.\n\nOperating under the African Union's Agenda 2063 and guided by a strategic plan for 2023-2027, Africa CDC strives to enhance health sovereignty, improve health outcomes, strengthen emergency response capabilities, and foster knowledge-sharing and institutional strengthening across African countries. Through these efforts, Africa CDC empowers Africa’s health security and advances the continent’s ability to manage current and future public health threats effectively.",

This independent body serves as the principal advisory group to WHO AFRO for strategic guidance on all matters pertaining to public health emergency preparedness and response.\nThe EPR Technical Advisory Group will play a critical role in supporting WHO African Member States to fortify health security in the face of diverse emergencies. Countries in the WHO African Region experience over 100 health emergencies annually which disrupt the economy and prosperity of communities and weaken already fragile health systems. With climate change and conflict aggravating more than half of Africa’s health emergencies, the next pandemic is not just a possibility, it's imminent. It is imperative, now more than ever, to enhance the Emergency Preparedness and Response capabilities within the Region.\nComposed of 16 distinguished experts (details below) from diverse fields like epidemiology, public health, global health, vaccinology, paediatrics, nutrition, internal medicine, infectious diseases, programme management, health-care administration, health economics, health communication, sociology, the EPR-TAG advises the WHO AFRO Regional Director on key issues. These include assessing the regional context of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies; conducting horizon scanning for new and emerging threats; providing strategic guidance on preparedness, response, and recovery strategies; reviewing progress in implementing regional health security initiatives; and strengthening country ownership and decision-making in emergency response.\nThe EPR-TAG is chaired by Dr Deo Nshimirimana, a retired WHO medical doctor renowned for his expertise in immunization in emergency settings. Assisting him is Dr Rebecca Martin, Vice President of Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute, appointed as the Vice-Chairperson. Dr Martin brings decades of experience in health security, emergency response and immunization. Both leaders bring a wealth of experience in public health and will guide the EPR-TAG for an initial three-year term. \"The opportunity to lead the EPR-TAG is a great honour, and I am thrilled to be part of this transformative team. I am confident that our collective expertise will significantly contribute to enhancing Africa's preparedness and response capabilities, ensuring a more resilient defence against ongoing and future health threats. Together, we can make a substantial impact on the well-being of African nations.\" - Dr Deo Nshimirimana.\nDr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, commented on the establishment of the EPR-TAG, stating: \"The Emergency Preparedness & Response technical group will play a critical role in strengthening our capacity, working collectively with partners, to support countries to prepare for, respond to, recover from public health emergencies while continuing to provide essential health care, across the African Region. I look forward, with our team, to leveraging its diverse expertise and independent perspective, for the benefit of our Member States.\"\nThe inaugural meeting of this prestigious group is taking place in Saly, Senegal from 16 to 17 July 2024. This gathering marks a historic moment as the EPR-TAG begins its journey to enhance health security across the African region. The establishment of the EPR-TAG underlines WHO AFRO's commitment to building a stronger, more resilient African Region prepared to face any public health challenge. With its expert guidance and collaborative approach, the EPR-TAG will play a vital role in protecting the health and well-being of millions of people across the continent.\nFor more information, please feel free to contact WHO via\neprtag\n[at]\nwho.int\n(eprtag[at]who[dot]int)\nList of the WHO AFRO Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG) Members\nName\nNationality\nDesignation\n1\nDeo NSHIMIRIMANA\n(EPR-TAG Chairperson)\nBurundi\nPublic Health Consultant\n2\nRebecca MARTIN\n(EPR-TAG Vice-Chairperson)\nUSA\nVice President, Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute\n3\nRick BRIGHT\nUSA\nCEO, Bright Global Health\n4\nDeoraj CAUSSY\nMauritius\nEpidemiologist, 360 Epidemiology Solutions\n5\nBernice DAHN\nLiberia\nVice President/Executive Dean, College of Health Sciences, University of Liberia\n6\nWafaa El-SADR\nEgypt\nFounder & Director, ICAP, Columbia University\n7\nNyasha GUZHA-CHANETSA\nZimbabwe\nChief State Veterinarian (Public Health & Trade Facilitation), South African Department of Agriculture, Rural Development & Environment\n8\nBanda KHALIFA\nGhana\nGlobal Health Expert and Managing Director, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Advancing Health Systems Innovations (CAdHSI)\n9\nRodrigue KOHOUN\nBenin\nPHC Technical Advisor to the Ministry of Health, Benin\n10\nAgnes MAHOMVA\nZimbabwe\nPublic Health Advisor to the President and Cabinet, Office of the President and Cabinet, Zimbabwe\n11\nBrice Wilfried BICABA\nBurkina Faso\nDirector General, Health & Public Hygiene, Ministry of Health, Burkina Faso\n12\nCheikh Tidiane MBOW\nSenegal\nChief, Health Promotion & Infectious Diseases Prevention Unit, MONUSCO (Goma",

This initiative will provide financial incentives to help vaccine manufacturers in Africa scale up production and become sustainable on a long-term basis.\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance, launched its replenishment campaign asking for $9 billion in new pledges, out of a total need of $11.9 billion, with $2.9 billion available in existing donor pledges, investment income, and leftover resources from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gavi has received $2.4 billion in new pledges, with $1.58 billion of that coming from the United States.\n“Today is a great day for Africa, thanks to this event,” said Dr. Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC Director General, at the event. “This financing will continue to reduce the gap and increase fairness and equity,” he said. “We are launching AVMA today, which will allow us, between now and 2040, to produce 60% of our vaccines,” Dr. Kaseya added.\nHe also announced that Africa will organize a launching ceremony of AVMA in Africa for African leaders, partners, non-governmental organizations, and community organizations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to ensure regional diversification of vaccine manufacturing. A lack of local manufacturing capacity in Africa and other parts of the world meant that the African continent had to wait longer for vaccines to become available. “Our vision is not restricted to only producing vaccines locally but also covers the production of drugs, diagnostics, and other healing products,” Dr. Kaseya said.\n“With our Alliance on track to meet almost all of the goals we set for 2025, we need also to consider how we can accelerate our progress and broaden the protection we can provide to populations for the rest of this decade,” said Professor José Manuel Barroso, Chair of the Board of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “As Gavi sets these ambitious goals, I am grateful for the leadership of France, the African Union, and Africa CDC as we make the case for investing in immunization and strengthening global health security.”\nMeanwhile, on the sidelines of the Global Forum for Vaccine Sovereignty and Innovation in Paris, France, the Africa CDC and African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) renewed their partnership with a new cooperation agreement announced on 20 June. Through this collaboration, Afreximbank committed a USD 2 billion facility to the “Africa Health Security Investment Plan” to support the health product manufacturing ambition of the continent. This initiative will focus on the African Pooled Procurement Mechanism (APPM) and the Platform for Harmonized African Health Products Manufacturing (PHAHM). It also intends to complement GAVI’s innovative financing mechanism, the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), which is set to provide up to USD 1 billion in financing to African manufacturers of health and pharmaceutical products over the next ten years.\n28 June 2024\nTheme\nAVMA\n,\nAfrican Vaccine Manufacturing\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

To tackle these challenges, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are pleased to announce the launch of a Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP). This pioneering five-year strategic collaboration will boost emergency preparedness and response efforts throughout Africa and thus ensure disease outbreaks during humanitarian crises and otherwise are managed efficiently.\nThe JEAP underlines the shared vision of Africa’s two leading public health institutions – to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent. The plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives while capitalising on the Africa CDC and WHO’s unique capabilities and resources. Aligned with the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order, WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030), and WHO EMRO’s four-year strategy for the Eastern Mediterranean region to address health emergencies – the JEAP strengthens emergency preparedness and response across six critical areas.\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health. JEAP will bolster our collective efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with the Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nPriority areas of action are strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection; stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations (70% of response activities during emergencies relate to such supply chain measures); and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. Most critically, this ground-breaking collaboration outlines impactful initiatives to be implemented in unison with countries to enhance the continent’s capacity to detect, monitor, and respond swiftly to health emergencies. In a first-of-its kind collaboration, the JEAP serves as a guiding beacon for targeted emergency response interventions and embodies the importance of cross-cutting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and resource mobilisation.\n“Africa CDC is proud to partner for this important continental strategic plan. Joining forces with WHO will significantly improve our ability to safeguard the health of African populations during times of crisis. Together, we will build resilient health systems and ensure a coordinated and effective response to emergencies across the continent,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC.\nIn an inspiring take, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean reiterated, “This visionary collaboration will breathe new life into the efficiency of current coordination mechanisms, strengthen institutions, and ultimately help us deliver quality healthcare services to our communities.”\nThese efforts are galvanising the commitments from governments, health agencies, and stakeholders to strengthen health emergency preparedness, detection, and response efforts. Through collective action and unwavering commitment, we will build resilient systems, enhance capacities, and safeguard the well-being of our communities. This partnership is a testament to our unwavering dedication to a healthier, safer Africa.\nPopular Tags\nWe are thrilled to announce the success of our recent AHRO webinar\nLatest Posts\n£25 Million Multi Clinical Trials Centers established by AHRO Network\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Starts identification of small molecules for some priority pathogens\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Institute to Add Undergraduate Courses to Its Portfolio\nDecember 27, 2024\nAHRO Appoints Five Ambassadors\nDecember 23, 2024\nAHRO Launches “Climate Change and One Health Project”\nDecember 19, 2024\nDr. Aasma Siddiqui Joins AHRO for 6-Month Fellowship\nDecember 19, 2024\nAHRO Courses to Officially Commence in January 2025\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Clinical Research Program Officially Launched\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO joins the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Confer Doctorate Degree to Hajia Hajara Shardow and Barbara Ngomo\nDecember 14, 2024\nAfrica Consultative Summit on Climate Change and One Health Organized by AHRO Center for Academic Research (UK)\nOctober 12, 2024\nPoverty Alleviation in Africa: The Way Forward – A Must-Watch Interview with Princess Nana Yakubu\nSeptember 6, 2024\nAHRO Commences Fellowship program, first cohort in 2025\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO opens five representative offices in West Africa\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Dubai to lead the product development program\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Canada to oversee commercialization and IP activities\nJune 13, 2024\n“AHRO will become one of the leaders in small drug molecules research”- Prof Yaro\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO appoints new Scientific Advisory Board\nJune 13, 2024\n“We are ready”- Dr Christine Nyirahabimana\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO starts its exploratory research activities\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO Starts electing Emeritus Fellows\nJuly 25, 2023",

This renders antibiotics and other antimicrobials less effective, causing treatment failures, increased disease spread, severe illness, disability and higher mortality rates.\nDespite the estimated USD2-6 billion needed annually for an effective AMR response across Africa, current funding is only a tenth of that allocated to other major diseases. This underfunding makes AMR a significant barrier to sustainable development, hindering progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.\nAn estimated 700,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections globally. Without timely intervention, this number is projected to reach 10 million by 2050, with Africa accounting for 4.5 million.\n“Fighting disease requires resources and working with member states and our partners we need to do all we can to save lives,” said Dr Tajudeen, speaking at the launch of a report on AMR in Africa. The event also initiated discussions on a roadmap and targets to advance Africa’s battle against AMR. The outcomes are expected to inform the upcoming United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting in September—a crucial platform for global action on this escalating crisis.\nDr Huyam Salih, the director of the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), emphasized the critical role that the AU must play in combating AMR. “Antimicrobial resistance is not just a health issue—it is a threat to our agrifood systems, food safety, food security, livelihoods, and economies,” she said.\nBy 2050, global healthcare costs could exceed USD1 trillion per year, and livestock production could decline by 2.6% to 7.5% annually due to AMR, according to Dr Salih. “In Africa, the situation is particularly alarming, with 37 countries reporting the prevalence of AMR in animal farms, yet only 16% of African countries are conducting routine AMR surveillance in animals as of 2023,” she said.\nDr Salih also called for urgent action to strengthen leadership, expand surveillance and data systems, promote the responsible use of antimicrobials, improve public and animal health systems, and secure sustainable financing to combat AMR effectively. “Our health, our food, and our future depend on the actions we take now,” she stressed.\nDr Tajudeen said addressing AMR in Africa requires engaging all levels of society in a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. “Unless we work together, overcoming antimicrobial resistance will be a difficult and long-drawn process that will cost lives,” he said.\nCurrently, millions in Africa lack access to essential antibiotics, with a study by Africa CDC and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine revealing that only 1.3% of microbiology labs in 14 member states can test for key AMR pathogens.\nThe head of the African Society for Laboratory Medicine, Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, reaffirmed the organization’s commitment to strengthening African laboratory capacities to combat antimicrobial resistance. “Our goal is to ensure the continued efficacy of treatments and promote data-driven solutions to safeguard public health across the continent,” he said.\nDr Tajudeen underscored the importance of prioritizing infection prevention, strengthening health and food systems, developing human resources, ensuring sustainable access to diagnostics and therapeutics, and investing in laboratory infrastructure for effective surveillance and data generation.\nThe report recommends an increase in the availability of high-quality diagnostics, vaccines, and antimicrobials for high-priority pathogens in high-risk African countries.\nFor more information\n:\nMedia inquiries:\nMargaret Edwin,\nDirector of Communication & Public Information Division: Africa CDC | Tel: +251 986 632 878 | Email:\nEdwinM@africacdc.org\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.
