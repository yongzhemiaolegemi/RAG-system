CEPI stands ready to support Africa CDC in the realisation of these goals and to further strengthen Africa’s preparedness and resilience against future outbreaks.”\nIn line with the African Union’s (A.U.) ambition to produce 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs in Africa by 2040 under the Africa CDC’s Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM);  the expanded partnership will ultimately focus its efforts on enhancing research and development, building a workforce as well as supply chain optimization to support resilient health systems This ambition will increase vaccine sovereignty and reduce external reliance, helping prevent a recurrence of the vaccine inequity seen during the COVID-19 response in Africa.\nTo boost vaccine accessibility and efficiency and meet this goal, there is a need to invest in vaccine R&D and manufacturing innovations, amongst others, and build a resilient regional supply chain. To that end, Africa CDC and CEPI will coordinate to fund innovations accelerating speed, scale, or accessibility for initial implementation with African manufacturers. This investment will support sustainable manufacturing for routine vaccinations in Africa, and—in the event of an outbreak—these facilities can be mobilized to produce response vaccines promptly.\nIn alignment with Africa CDC, the partnership also aims to bolster Africa’s research ecosystem and clinical trial infrastructure, including targeted capacity strengthening through CEPI’s\nResearch Preparedness Program\n—which, directed by regional experts, aims to build capacity for conducting high-quality Phase 3 efficacy trials.\nBuilding on existing clinical trial capability in some African countries is vital as vaccine candidates against endemic diseases, such as\nLassa fever\n, progress into late-stage development. Phase 3 trials provide essential data required for vaccine approval and must take place in regions where the disease is prevalent. A\nCEPI-funded Phase 2 trial for a Lassa fever vaccine\ncandidate is already underway; it is crucial that if this candidate, or another, is successful, there is regional capability to further its path toward licensure. Once established, this capability can benefit other regional actors advancing to late-stage research.\nThe organizations will also collaborate to enhance vaccine safety protocols, biosecurity, pathogen surveillance, investment in capacity building, and other areas that help ensure overall African readiness for emergency vaccine responses.\nAfrica CDC and CEPI are committed to this cooperation, which will strengthen collaboration and deliver tangible results to deliver Africa’s long-term health security ambitions.\n—END\n—\nNotes to Editors\nAbout CEPI\nCEPI was launched in 2017 as an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civil organisations. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic disease threats and enable equitable access to them. CEPI has supported the development of more than 50 vaccine candidates or platform technologies against multiple known high-risk pathogens and is also advancing the development of rapid response platforms for vaccines against a future Disease X. Central to CEPI’s pandemic-beating five-year plan for 2022-2026 is the ‘100 Days Mission’ to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days.\nAbout Africa CDC\nAbout Africa CDC: The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

The Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative, a bold and unprecedented $1.5 billion partnership, was launched in June 2021. This innovative and ground-breaking partnership aimed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, roll out vaccinations, build the vaccine manufacturing workforce for the continent, and strengthen the Africa CDC to ensure long-term health security for Africa.\nUnprecedented in scale, speed and inclusion of African organisations, the partnership has\ncontributed to the continent’s current vaccination rate of 53 per cent of\nthe target population, up from just 3 per cent at the start of the initiative. The partnership has also trained, equipped, and deployed 38,000 health workers, creating a robust frontline in safeguarding public health locally. It has provided job opportunities for 23,000 individuals and integrated over 600 COVID-19 vaccination centres into healthcare systems. Additionally, this initiative led to the expansion of genomic testing capabilities from seven to 40 laboratories across the continent.\nThe review of Phase 1 of this initiative, among fifteen implementing partners across 29 countries, conducted by Deloitte, indicates that the vast majority of funds disbursed were used effectively and as intended. Likewise, ongoing monitoring by KPMG has confirmed that partners not only showed strength in programmatic results but also improved the institutional capacity for greater sustainability and institutional resilience.\n“Our Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative with the Mastercard Foundation has shown the power of respectful and action-oriented partnerships rooted in collaboration, coordination and systems strengthening. The experience and learnings from Phase I will enable us to move with greater speed and scale to deliver with accelerated impact to our member states” said\nDr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC\n.\nIn its second phase, the partnership will expand its scope and scale, focusing on completing the vaccination of healthcare workers and vulnerable groups, building a robust workforce of community health workers, ensuring pandemic preparedness by bolstering national public health institutions, laboratory capacities, data access and quality, local manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, and continuing strengthening of Africa CDC.\n“While the global pandemic may be declared over, the need to continue investing in our health systems, build our workforce and prepare for future pandemics remains urgent. This partnership will ensure that we have strong health institutions and systems. We aim to enable thousands of young people to build their careers in healthcare and contribute to improving lives in Africa,” said\nReeta Roy, President, and CEO of the Mastercard Foundation.\nThe Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative stands out as a testament to the power of African-led health solutions. As it progresses to its next phase, partnerships will continue to play a crucial role in shaping a New Public Health Order for Africa. Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation remain committed to improving the health and well-being of all Africans.\n-ENDS-\nAbout the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\nAfrica CDC is a continental autonomous health agency of the African Union established to support public health initiatives of Member States and strengthen the capacity of their public health institutions to detect, prevent, control, and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats.

The planned Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) was announced during the Mpox in Africa—High-Level Emergency Regional Meeting, held in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 11 to 13 April. “We propose the establishment of an African-led multi-disciplinary, multicountry Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa with the overarching goal of establishing a research network to advance the elimination of mpox,” Jean B. Nachega (Professor Extraordinary of Medicine Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases Stellenbosch University Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences) told the meeting.\nMpox is endemic to 12 countries in Africa\nNachega said Africa has faced a long-standing unmet need for sustainable local diagnostic laboratories and research capacity for mpox.\n“MpoxReC will address these needs and provide outcome monitoring and surveillance across endemic African countries while simultaneously contributing to much-needed South-South, multi-disciplinary, and inter-professional research collaborations and capacity-building,” he said. He said the continent needs to share national and regional epidemic preparedness frameworks on the disease.\nThe research group, which includes global partners and African collaborators, will initially focus on Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, and the Republic of Congo.  Professor Nadia Sam-Agudu will lead researchers at the University of Cape Coast Ghana, Professor Samuel Nakoune Yandoko will head the team at Pasteur Institute in Bangui, the Central African Republic, co-principal investigators Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe and Professor Placide Mbala will represent the DRC’s Institute National Research Biomedical, Professor Dimie Ogoina from Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital will represent Nigeria, Cameroon’s Pasteur Institute research team will be led by Professor Richard Njouom and Congo will be led by Professor Francine Ntoumi from the Congolese Foundation for Medical Research. Expansion to other African countries will take place later.\n28 April 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nDiseases\nMpox\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

On average, 100 disease outbreaks are reported annually in Africa.\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “JEAP will bolster our efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” she said.\nThe plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives, including the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order and WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030).\nJEAP prioritizes strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection, stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations, and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. They also plan to overcome supply chain barriers by reducing delays in delivering lifesaving supplies from 20 days to 24-48 hours, mitigating morbidity and mortality. The JEAP partnership welcomed UNICEF as the first partner to join this partnership, which holds great promise for transforming health security on the continent.\n29 May 2024\nTheme\nEmergency Response and Preparedness\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

To tackle these challenges, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are pleased to announce the launch of a Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP). This pioneering five-year strategic collaboration will boost emergency preparedness and response efforts throughout Africa and thus ensure disease outbreaks during humanitarian crises and otherwise are managed efficiently.\nThe JEAP underlines the shared vision of Africa’s two leading public health institutions – to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent. The plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives while capitalising on the Africa CDC and WHO’s unique capabilities and resources. Aligned with the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order, WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030), and WHO EMRO’s four-year strategy for the Eastern Mediterranean region to address health emergencies – the JEAP strengthens emergency preparedness and response across six critical areas.\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health. JEAP will bolster our collective efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with the Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nPriority areas of action are strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection; stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations (70% of response activities during emergencies relate to such supply chain measures); and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. Most critically, this ground-breaking collaboration outlines impactful initiatives to be implemented in unison with countries to enhance the continent’s capacity to detect, monitor, and respond swiftly to health emergencies. In a first-of-its kind collaboration, the JEAP serves as a guiding beacon for targeted emergency response interventions and embodies the importance of cross-cutting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and resource mobilisation.\n“Africa CDC is proud to partner for this important continental strategic plan. Joining forces with WHO will significantly improve our ability to safeguard the health of African populations during times of crisis. Together, we will build resilient health systems and ensure a coordinated and effective response to emergencies across the continent,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC.\nIn an inspiring take, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean reiterated, “This visionary collaboration will breathe new life into the efficiency of current coordination mechanisms, strengthen institutions, and ultimately help us deliver quality healthcare services to our communities.”\nThese efforts are galvanising the commitments from governments, health agencies, and stakeholders to strengthen health emergency preparedness, detection, and response efforts. Through collective action and unwavering commitment, we will build resilient systems, enhance capacities, and safeguard the well-being of our communities. This partnership is a testament to our unwavering dedication to a healthier, safer Africa.\nPopular Tags\nWe are thrilled to announce the success of our recent AHRO webinar\nLatest Posts\n£25 Million Multi Clinical Trials Centers established by AHRO Network\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Starts identification of small molecules for some priority pathogens\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Institute to Add Undergraduate Courses to Its Portfolio\nDecember 27, 2024\nAHRO Appoints Five Ambassadors\nDecember 23, 2024\nAHRO Launches “Climate Change and One Health Project”\nDecember 19, 2024\nDr. Aasma Siddiqui Joins AHRO for 6-Month Fellowship\nDecember 19, 2024\nAHRO Courses to Officially Commence in January 2025\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Clinical Research Program Officially Launched\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO joins the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Confer Doctorate Degree to Hajia Hajara Shardow and Barbara Ngomo\nDecember 14, 2024\nAfrica Consultative Summit on Climate Change and One Health Organized by AHRO Center for Academic Research (UK)\nOctober 12, 2024\nPoverty Alleviation in Africa: The Way Forward – A Must-Watch Interview with Princess Nana Yakubu\nSeptember 6, 2024\nAHRO Commences Fellowship program, first cohort in 2025\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO opens five representative offices in West Africa\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Dubai to lead the product development program\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Canada to oversee commercialization and IP activities\nJune 13, 2024\n“AHRO will become one of the leaders in small drug molecules research”- Prof Yaro\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO appoints new Scientific Advisory Board\nJune 13, 2024\n“We are ready”- Dr Christine Nyirahabimana\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO starts its exploratory research activities\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO Starts electing Emeritus Fellows\nJuly 25, 2023",
