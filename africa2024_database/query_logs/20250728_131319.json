            "description": "Africa CDC (Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention) is the specialized, continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union dedicated to strengthening health institutions and capacities across Africa. Its primary mission is to enhance disease surveillance, outbreak response, and emergency preparedness to detect, prevent, control, and manage health threats throughout the continent. As a leading public health institution in Africa, Africa CDC plays a central role in building health security and coordinating regional responses to infectious disease epidemics, including mpox, by collaborating closely with African governments and global partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union, and Gavi.\n\nAfrica CDC actively co-leads initiatives like the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to address disease outbreaks and public health emergencies, while providing technical support, capacity building, and epidemic response coordination. The agency emphasizes genomic surveillance strategies as part of its comprehensive approach to managing public health challenges and strengthening health systems continent-wide.\n\nIn addition to its role in disease control, Africa CDC leads and supports critical vaccine manufacturing initiatives, including the African Vaccine Manufacturing Alliance (AVMA), with the goal of increasing local production to meet 60% of Africa’s demand for vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics by 2040. The agency promotes sustainable vaccine development, regulatory harmonization, decentralization of diagnostics, and localization of health product manufacturing to build resilient and self-sufficient health systems.\n\nOperating under the African Union's Agenda 2063 and guided by a strategic plan for 2023-2027, Africa CDC strives to enhance health sovereignty, improve health outcomes, strengthen emergency response capabilities, and foster knowledge-sharing and institutional strengthening across African countries. Through these efforts, Africa CDC empowers Africa’s health security and advances the continent’s ability to manage current and future public health threats effectively.",

This renders antibiotics and other antimicrobials less effective, causing treatment failures, increased disease spread, severe illness, disability and higher mortality rates.\nDespite the estimated USD2-6 billion needed annually for an effective AMR response across Africa, current funding is only a tenth of that allocated to other major diseases. This underfunding makes AMR a significant barrier to sustainable development, hindering progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.\nAn estimated 700,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections globally. Without timely intervention, this number is projected to reach 10 million by 2050, with Africa accounting for 4.5 million.\n“Fighting disease requires resources and working with member states and our partners we need to do all we can to save lives,” said Dr Tajudeen, speaking at the launch of a report on AMR in Africa. The event also initiated discussions on a roadmap and targets to advance Africa’s battle against AMR. The outcomes are expected to inform the upcoming United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting in September—a crucial platform for global action on this escalating crisis.\nDr Huyam Salih, the director of the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), emphasized the critical role that the AU must play in combating AMR. “Antimicrobial resistance is not just a health issue—it is a threat to our agrifood systems, food safety, food security, livelihoods, and economies,” she said.\nBy 2050, global healthcare costs could exceed USD1 trillion per year, and livestock production could decline by 2.6% to 7.5% annually due to AMR, according to Dr Salih. “In Africa, the situation is particularly alarming, with 37 countries reporting the prevalence of AMR in animal farms, yet only 16% of African countries are conducting routine AMR surveillance in animals as of 2023,” she said.\nDr Salih also called for urgent action to strengthen leadership, expand surveillance and data systems, promote the responsible use of antimicrobials, improve public and animal health systems, and secure sustainable financing to combat AMR effectively. “Our health, our food, and our future depend on the actions we take now,” she stressed.\nDr Tajudeen said addressing AMR in Africa requires engaging all levels of society in a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. “Unless we work together, overcoming antimicrobial resistance will be a difficult and long-drawn process that will cost lives,” he said.\nCurrently, millions in Africa lack access to essential antibiotics, with a study by Africa CDC and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine revealing that only 1.3% of microbiology labs in 14 member states can test for key AMR pathogens.\nThe head of the African Society for Laboratory Medicine, Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, reaffirmed the organization’s commitment to strengthening African laboratory capacities to combat antimicrobial resistance. “Our goal is to ensure the continued efficacy of treatments and promote data-driven solutions to safeguard public health across the continent,” he said.\nDr Tajudeen underscored the importance of prioritizing infection prevention, strengthening health and food systems, developing human resources, ensuring sustainable access to diagnostics and therapeutics, and investing in laboratory infrastructure for effective surveillance and data generation.\nThe report recommends an increase in the availability of high-quality diagnostics, vaccines, and antimicrobials for high-priority pathogens in high-risk African countries.\nFor more information\n:\nMedia inquiries:\nMargaret Edwin,\nDirector of Communication & Public Information Division: Africa CDC | Tel: +251 986 632 878 | Email:\nEdwinM@africacdc.org\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

The United Kingdom’s dedication to addressing the world’s most pressing health challenges through research, development, and collaboration is both commendable and inspiring.\nThe allocation of the United Kingdom’s investment of £95 million in tackling deadly diseases in Africa Programme II, will foster partnerships with countries and Africa-based organizations — Africa CDC and WHO — to detect and address future epidemics, combat drug-resistant infections, and address climate-related health challenges. Such collaborative efforts are essential in building stronger health systems and ensuring a more secure future for all.\nWe also commend the allocation of up to £103.5 million for the development of affordable vaccines and health products, along with initiatives to combat the spread of infectious diseases, particularly during pandemics, as a demonstration of the United Kingdom’s leadership in the field of global health. This investment will undoubtedly contribute to safeguarding the health and well-being of populations worldwide, preventing future outbreaks, and ultimately saving lives.\nThe commitment to protecting women’s sexual and reproductive health is a crucial step towards achieving a more equitable and inclusive world. By reducing preventable deaths and improving access to care, the United Kingdom is actively working to realize the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063 in promoting the well-being of all, regardless of geographic location.\nThe United Kingdom’s support for research and development in low- and middle-income countries, including advancements in drug administration methods, showcases a commitment to reaching even the most remote areas with life-saving care. This approach aligns with the principles of inclusivity and resilience that are fundamental to the global health agenda.\nThe commitment to health security by the United Kingdom through international development is evident in its track record of investing in research, development, and healthcare infrastructure. The impact of these efforts, from malaria treatments to diagnostics for drug-resistant tuberculosis, has been significant and has undoubtedly saved countless lives.\nWe would like to express our deep appreciation for the United Kingdom’s resolute dedication to advancing global health.

Low health investment and limited prioritization of the health workforce have critically exposed health systems. Investment in health, especially from domestic sources, is still low and inadequate for many countries to meet the universal health coverage and ensure health security\n“The numbers of Africans who have left the continent in search of greener pastures in other parts of the world are staggering. It is a matter that needs to be addressed as a top priority for African governments and indeed all those who wish to see a shift in the historical as well as current trends,” said Honourable Dr Kalumbi Shangula, Minister of Health and Social Services of Namibia.\nThe charter launched today brought together the health workforce investment efforts of all stakeholders, including national governments, the private health sector, civil society, external financing institutions and development partners in Africa.\n“By investing in the health workforce, we not only address the challenges within the sector but also generate dividends in education, employment and gender equality,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “These investments will contribute to our sustained efforts in attracting more resources and improving the quality of our health workforce.”\nInvesting in the health workforce will have positive spin-offs in the form of decent jobs, particularly for women and youth who often face barriers to employment. By providing opportunities for education, training and career progression, the Charter will immensely contribute to the economic empowerment of these demographics and fundamentally support inclusive economic growth.\nAdditionally, health labour force investment also brings multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage.\nFor every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, and that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%.\n“Studies show that investments in the health sector yield substantial economic returns, estimating a nine-to-one return on investment. The new narrative that we are promoting is to transform the health sector to move from liability to an asset for the economy of our countries,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter was inaugurated in Namibia during the Health Workforce Investment Forum being held from 6 to 8 May 2024. Efforts will continue to be made to engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)",

The MoU was signed by H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, and Rémi Maréchaux, Ambassador of France to Ethiopia, at a ceremony held at the Africa CDC Secretariat Offices in Addis Ababa.\nThe MoU aims to strengthen Africa CDC’s efforts to build more robust public health systems and improve health security across the continent. Key areas of collaboration under the MoU include strengthening Africa CDC’s capacity; supporting the development of national public health institutes; enhancing disease surveillance and emergency response capacities; promoting local manufacturing of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics; supporting workforce training; and fostering research partnerships between French and African institutions.\n“The signing of this MoU solidifies our shared vision in nurturing a coordinated global response to global public health challenges. This action-oriented framework aims to advance the New Public Health order, enhance health workforce development, and strengthen public health systems for the benefit of all African citizens,” said H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya at the signing ceremony.\nThis MoU builds on France’s longstanding support for public health in Africa. France played a leading role in launching the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator and has donated 10 million vaccine doses to the AVAT mechanism and 48 million doses to 40 African states, mainly through the COVAX initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. The French Development Agency provided a €50 million line of credit to Afreximbank for the AVAT payment facility, enabling vaccine purchases by Uganda, Burundi, DRC and Egypt. The AFD has committed over €500 million to health programs in Africa through its ” Santé en Commun ” (Health in Common) initiative. France also provides technical expertise to Africa CDC in infection, prevention and control (IPC) and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH).\nFrance is a major contributor to Team Europe Initiatives that align with Africa CDC’s priorities, like strengthening pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity on the continent with over €70 million mobilized so far. France also supports regional health projects in West and Central Africa that reinforce Africa CDC’s diagnostics, surveillance, and regulation objectives.\nThe signing of this MoU signals France and Africa CDC’s continued commitment to mutually tackling major public health challenges in the  interest of public health, safety, and security of all African citizens,”\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\nMikaele THOMAS\nPress department at the French Embassy Tél : 01 11 40 00 25 Mél : Mikaele.thomas@diplomatie.gouv.fr\nPO Box 1464, Addis-Ababa Yeka   Kebele : 01102, Addis Abeba\nDorothy Njagi\n| Senior Communication Officer- Policy, Health Diplomacy & Communication | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: email:\nnjagid@africa-union.org\n| Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nAbout Africa CDC\n: Africa CDC is an autonomous health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

African leaders pledge to increase the share of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics locally manufactured in Africa to 60% by 2040. This vision will be achieved by establishing a sustainable vaccine development and manufacturing ecosystem underpinned by research and development, intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer, robust regulatory systems, innovative and sustainable financing, strategic partnerships, and commitment by African and global procurement agencies to purchase vaccines produced on the continent.\nSince the late 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided a safety, quality, and efficacy assurance assessment process, now known as “WHO prequalification” (PQ), to ensure vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and other health products supplied by procurement agencies meet acceptable standards and to facilitate the regulatory review and uptake of health products in Iow-resource settings.\nIn Africa, the slow process of WHO PQ was seen as one of the key limitations on the way to achieving the local manufacturing agenda. In this context, Africa CDC welcomes the new\nWHO policy\nto initiate parallel processes both for recommendation guidelines and PQ or Emergency Use Listing Procedure (EUL) assessment as an important step in addressing the inequity in rapidly accessing essential and innovative health products. The use of interim guidelines, especially for innovator products, will be useful in accelerating timelines. Nevertheless, they require significant efforts to address the high data and evidence standards, know how to produce a complete dossier for submission and interact with PQ’s consultation processes.\nOne of the critical and intrinsic factors for sustainable manufacturing in Africa is ensuring that African manufacturers have access to efficient and harmonized regulatory pathways that ensure high-quality products and market access for African-made products. The acquisition of maturity level 3 (ML3) status in five (5) African countries, coupled with ongoing competency programs through Regional Centres for Regulatory Excellence (RCOREs), underscores the critical importance for African regulatory experts to possess expertise and capabilities that align with adequate regulatory oversight across the entire lifecycle of vaccine production.\nLengthy and fragmented processes to acquire regulatory approval will lead to late market access and financial and administrative burdens for African manufacturers. In addressing this,\nachieving WHO prequalification to enter the United Nations (UN) procurement system\nis particularly important for African manufacturers to reach the economics of scales necessary to foster a conducive manufacturing eco-system, including Research and Development. We encourage WHO to continue to support the strengthening of these important activities and engagement and communication across diverse stakeholder communities. Africa CDC will continue to monitor the progress and execution of these and similar recommendations for the benefits of local manufacturing of pharmaceutical products in Africa.\n3 April 2024\nTheme\nRespectful Partnership\nRegion\nCentral Africa\n,\nEastern Africa\n,\nNorthern Africa\n,\nSouthern Africa\n,\nWestern Africa\nRelated Content\nMedia Advisory\nWeekly Special Press Briefing on Health Emergencies in Africa\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 14 – 20 July 2025\nPress Releases\nAfrica Launches Continental Strategy to Decentralize Diagnostics and Accelerate Outbreak Response\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 7 – 13 July 2025\nPress Releases\nMalawi Launches Second Edition of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance Strategy and Implementation Plan\nWeekly Briefs\nAfrica CDC Weekly Brief | 30 June-6 July 2025\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nFacebook-f\nYoutube\nFlickr\nInstagram\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
