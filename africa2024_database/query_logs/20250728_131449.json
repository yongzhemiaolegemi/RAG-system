Its primary mission is to enhance disease surveillance, outbreak response, and emergency preparedness to detect, prevent, control, and manage health threats throughout the continent. As a leading public health institution in Africa, Africa CDC plays a central role in building health security and coordinating regional responses to infectious disease epidemics, including mpox, by collaborating closely with African governments and global partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union, and Gavi.\n\nAfrica CDC actively co-leads initiatives like the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to address disease outbreaks and public health emergencies, while providing technical support, capacity building, and epidemic response coordination. The agency emphasizes genomic surveillance strategies as part of its comprehensive approach to managing public health challenges and strengthening health systems continent-wide.\n\nIn addition to its role in disease control, Africa CDC leads and supports critical vaccine manufacturing initiatives, including the African Vaccine Manufacturing Alliance (AVMA), with the goal of increasing local production to meet 60% of Africa’s demand for vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics by 2040. The agency promotes sustainable vaccine development, regulatory harmonization, decentralization of diagnostics, and localization of health product manufacturing to build resilient and self-sufficient health systems.\n\nOperating under the African Union's Agenda 2063 and guided by a strategic plan for 2023-2027, Africa CDC strives to enhance health sovereignty, improve health outcomes, strengthen emergency response capabilities, and foster knowledge-sharing and institutional strengthening across African countries. Through these efforts, Africa CDC empowers Africa’s health security and advances the continent’s ability to manage current and future public health threats effectively.",

CEPI stands ready to support Africa CDC in the realisation of these goals and to further strengthen Africa’s preparedness and resilience against future outbreaks.”\nIn line with the African Union’s (A.U.) ambition to produce 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs in Africa by 2040 under the Africa CDC’s Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM);  the expanded partnership will ultimately focus its efforts on enhancing research and development, building a workforce as well as supply chain optimization to support resilient health systems This ambition will increase vaccine sovereignty and reduce external reliance, helping prevent a recurrence of the vaccine inequity seen during the COVID-19 response in Africa.\nTo boost vaccine accessibility and efficiency and meet this goal, there is a need to invest in vaccine R&D and manufacturing innovations, amongst others, and build a resilient regional supply chain. To that end, Africa CDC and CEPI will coordinate to fund innovations accelerating speed, scale, or accessibility for initial implementation with African manufacturers. This investment will support sustainable manufacturing for routine vaccinations in Africa, and—in the event of an outbreak—these facilities can be mobilized to produce response vaccines promptly.\nIn alignment with Africa CDC, the partnership also aims to bolster Africa’s research ecosystem and clinical trial infrastructure, including targeted capacity strengthening through CEPI’s\nResearch Preparedness Program\n—which, directed by regional experts, aims to build capacity for conducting high-quality Phase 3 efficacy trials.\nBuilding on existing clinical trial capability in some African countries is vital as vaccine candidates against endemic diseases, such as\nLassa fever\n, progress into late-stage development. Phase 3 trials provide essential data required for vaccine approval and must take place in regions where the disease is prevalent. A\nCEPI-funded Phase 2 trial for a Lassa fever vaccine\ncandidate is already underway; it is crucial that if this candidate, or another, is successful, there is regional capability to further its path toward licensure. Once established, this capability can benefit other regional actors advancing to late-stage research.\nThe organizations will also collaborate to enhance vaccine safety protocols, biosecurity, pathogen surveillance, investment in capacity building, and other areas that help ensure overall African readiness for emergency vaccine responses.\nAfrica CDC and CEPI are committed to this cooperation, which will strengthen collaboration and deliver tangible results to deliver Africa’s long-term health security ambitions.\n—END\n—\nNotes to Editors\nAbout CEPI\nCEPI was launched in 2017 as an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civil organisations. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic disease threats and enable equitable access to them. CEPI has supported the development of more than 50 vaccine candidates or platform technologies against multiple known high-risk pathogens and is also advancing the development of rapid response platforms for vaccines against a future Disease X. Central to CEPI’s pandemic-beating five-year plan for 2022-2026 is the ‘100 Days Mission’ to compress the time taken to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days.\nAbout Africa CDC\nAbout Africa CDC: The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

The collaboration builds on the 2022-2024 Partnership Framework Agreement between Africa CDC and UNICEF, which aims to achieve the goals outlined in the African Union Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership is expected to have a significant impact on public health in Africa by strengthening procurement and supply chain systems, with a particular focus on immunisation for children across the continent.\nH.E Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of Africa CDC, and Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations, signed the expanded partnership agreement in Addis Ababa.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of many healthcare systems and highlighted deficiencies and challenges in medical supply chains. While countries with strong primary healthcare systems were better able to cope, the disruption caused by the pandemic left others facing shortages of vital medical commodities. Over the next four years, Africa CDC and UNICEF will work together to establish robust institutional backing for supply chain management and enhance pooled procurement mechanisms to fortify Africa’s healthcare infrastructure, ensuring timely and adequate access to essential medical supplies for its population.\nH.E Jean Kaseya expressed his pride in the partnership with UNICEF, stating that their shared commitments will enhance primary healthcare and strengthen Africa’s health security. ‘‘The partnership will optimise supply chain management, operationalise the pool procurement mechanism for Africa CDC, empower community health workers, and advance local manufacturing. Ultimately, these efforts will strengthen immunisation systems and reduce outbreaks and epidemics on the continent’’, he says.\nImmunisation is one of the most effective public health interventions globally. However, millions of children in Africa are still deprived of life-saving vaccinations.\nUNICEF’s The State of the World’s Children\n2023: For Every Child\n, Vaccination report revealed that 12.7 million children were under-vaccinated in 2021, including 8.7 million who did not receive a single dose, also called “zero-dose” children.\n“This partnership is a commitment to the well-being of children and their families, affirming their right to health. By strengthening our partnership with Africa CDC and the Joint Emergency Action Plan for Africa, we can ensure communities get the support they need without delay,” said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations. “The push forward on paid and protected community health workers, medical supplies made in Africa, for Africans, remains one of our highest priorities.”\nDuring the past two years, UNICEF and Africa CDC have achieved significant milestones in strengthening Africa CDC’s institutional capacity and catalysing community health programmes, immunisation systems, emergency response, and supply chain enhancement. Collaborative efforts secured the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses and essential cold chain equipment for routine immunisation. Joint high-level advocacy initiatives focused on immunisation, community health, and response to public health emergencies.\nAfrica imports 99% of its vaccines and 70 to 90% of its medicines and medical devices, which is a significant challenge. Africa CDC aims to achieve sustainable production and supply of essential health commodities through African manufacturers, considered Africa’s second independence by Africa CDC. Africa CDC’s goal is to work with African Union Member States and partners to actively advocate for and support the procurement of vaccines made in Africa and prioritise initiatives that strengthen local manufacturing.\nThrough the Partnership for Vaccine Manufacturing, Africa CDC aims to manufacture 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs by 2040, paving the way toward robust and self-reliant health systems, ensuring that people can obtain and use health commodities when and where required.\nThe expanded partnership between Africa CDC and UNICEF signifies a concerted effort to address Africa’s pressing health challenges. By prioritising immunisation, strengthening health systems, and promoting local production, both organisations are poised to make tangible and sustainable impacts on the health and well-being of children and communities across the continent while safeguarding Africa’s health security.\n#  #\nAbout the Partnership\nThe Africa CDC and UNICEF Partnership Framework Agreement, commenced in 2022 and extended today to 2027, contributes to the goals and objective of Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership framework outlines three programmatic areas of collaboration: (i) public health emergency preparedness and response; (ii) immunization systems strengthening; and (iii) procurement and supply chain systems strengthening. Under the partnership extension, this collaboration will expand, particularly in the areas of system strengthening for primary health care (including community health and nutrition systems), in supply chain management, regional and pooled procurement, manufacturing and emergency preparedness and response.\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

To tackle these challenges, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) are pleased to announce the launch of a Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP). This pioneering five-year strategic collaboration will boost emergency preparedness and response efforts throughout Africa and thus ensure disease outbreaks during humanitarian crises and otherwise are managed efficiently.\nThe JEAP underlines the shared vision of Africa’s two leading public health institutions – to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent. The plan builds upon existing frameworks and initiatives while capitalising on the Africa CDC and WHO’s unique capabilities and resources. Aligned with the Africa CDC’s New Public Health Order, WHO AFRO’s Regional Strategy for Health Security and Emergencies (2022-2030), and WHO EMRO’s four-year strategy for the Eastern Mediterranean region to address health emergencies – the JEAP strengthens emergency preparedness and response across six critical areas.\n“The collaboration between the Africa CDC and WHO exemplifies the power of partnership in global health. JEAP will bolster our collective efforts to fight public health emergencies, saving lives and protecting our communities. We are proud to stand with the Africa CDC and work towards a healthier and safer future for all Africans,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\nPriority areas of action are strengthening surveillance intelligence and genomic sequencing for quicker detection; stockpiling emergency supplies at newly established sub-regional hubs to improve emergency response operations (70% of response activities during emergencies relate to such supply chain measures); and deploying first responders within 24-48 hours of a disease outbreak. Most critically, this ground-breaking collaboration outlines impactful initiatives to be implemented in unison with countries to enhance the continent’s capacity to detect, monitor, and respond swiftly to health emergencies. In a first-of-its kind collaboration, the JEAP serves as a guiding beacon for targeted emergency response interventions and embodies the importance of cross-cutting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and resource mobilisation.\n“Africa CDC is proud to partner for this important continental strategic plan. Joining forces with WHO will significantly improve our ability to safeguard the health of African populations during times of crisis. Together, we will build resilient health systems and ensure a coordinated and effective response to emergencies across the continent,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC.\nIn an inspiring take, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean reiterated, “This visionary collaboration will breathe new life into the efficiency of current coordination mechanisms, strengthen institutions, and ultimately help us deliver quality healthcare services to our communities.”\nThese efforts are galvanising the commitments from governments, health agencies, and stakeholders to strengthen health emergency preparedness, detection, and response efforts. Through collective action and unwavering commitment, we will build resilient systems, enhance capacities, and safeguard the well-being of our communities. This partnership is a testament to our unwavering dedication to a healthier, safer Africa.\nPopular Tags\nWe are thrilled to announce the success of our recent AHRO webinar\nLatest Posts\n£25 Million Multi Clinical Trials Centers established by AHRO Network\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Starts identification of small molecules for some priority pathogens\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAHRO Institute to Add Undergraduate Courses to Its Portfolio\nDecember 27, 2024\nAHRO Appoints Five Ambassadors\nDecember 23, 2024\nAHRO Launches “Climate Change and One Health Project”\nDecember 19, 2024\nDr. Aasma Siddiqui Joins AHRO for 6-Month Fellowship\nDecember 19, 2024\nAHRO Courses to Officially Commence in January 2025\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Clinical Research Program Officially Launched\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO joins the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education\nDecember 14, 2024\nAHRO Confer Doctorate Degree to Hajia Hajara Shardow and Barbara Ngomo\nDecember 14, 2024\nAfrica Consultative Summit on Climate Change and One Health Organized by AHRO Center for Academic Research (UK)\nOctober 12, 2024\nPoverty Alleviation in Africa: The Way Forward – A Must-Watch Interview with Princess Nana Yakubu\nSeptember 6, 2024\nAHRO Commences Fellowship program, first cohort in 2025\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO opens five representative offices in West Africa\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Dubai to lead the product development program\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO-Canada to oversee commercialization and IP activities\nJune 13, 2024\n“AHRO will become one of the leaders in small drug molecules research”- Prof Yaro\nJune 13, 2024\nAHRO appoints new Scientific Advisory Board\nJune 13, 2024\n“We are ready”- Dr Christine Nyirahabimana\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO starts its exploratory research activities\nJuly 25, 2023\nAHRO Starts electing Emeritus Fellows\nJuly 25, 2023",

This independent body serves as the principal advisory group to WHO AFRO for strategic guidance on all matters pertaining to public health emergency preparedness and response.\nThe EPR Technical Advisory Group will play a critical role in supporting WHO African Member States to fortify health security in the face of diverse emergencies. Countries in the WHO African Region experience over 100 health emergencies annually which disrupt the economy and prosperity of communities and weaken already fragile health systems. With climate change and conflict aggravating more than half of Africa’s health emergencies, the next pandemic is not just a possibility, it's imminent. It is imperative, now more than ever, to enhance the Emergency Preparedness and Response capabilities within the Region.\nComposed of 16 distinguished experts (details below) from diverse fields like epidemiology, public health, global health, vaccinology, paediatrics, nutrition, internal medicine, infectious diseases, programme management, health-care administration, health economics, health communication, sociology, the EPR-TAG advises the WHO AFRO Regional Director on key issues. These include assessing the regional context of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies; conducting horizon scanning for new and emerging threats; providing strategic guidance on preparedness, response, and recovery strategies; reviewing progress in implementing regional health security initiatives; and strengthening country ownership and decision-making in emergency response.\nThe EPR-TAG is chaired by Dr Deo Nshimirimana, a retired WHO medical doctor renowned for his expertise in immunization in emergency settings. Assisting him is Dr Rebecca Martin, Vice President of Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute, appointed as the Vice-Chairperson. Dr Martin brings decades of experience in health security, emergency response and immunization. Both leaders bring a wealth of experience in public health and will guide the EPR-TAG for an initial three-year term. \"The opportunity to lead the EPR-TAG is a great honour, and I am thrilled to be part of this transformative team. I am confident that our collective expertise will significantly contribute to enhancing Africa's preparedness and response capabilities, ensuring a more resilient defence against ongoing and future health threats. Together, we can make a substantial impact on the well-being of African nations.\" - Dr Deo Nshimirimana.\nDr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, commented on the establishment of the EPR-TAG, stating: \"The Emergency Preparedness & Response technical group will play a critical role in strengthening our capacity, working collectively with partners, to support countries to prepare for, respond to, recover from public health emergencies while continuing to provide essential health care, across the African Region. I look forward, with our team, to leveraging its diverse expertise and independent perspective, for the benefit of our Member States.\"\nThe inaugural meeting of this prestigious group is taking place in Saly, Senegal from 16 to 17 July 2024. This gathering marks a historic moment as the EPR-TAG begins its journey to enhance health security across the African region. The establishment of the EPR-TAG underlines WHO AFRO's commitment to building a stronger, more resilient African Region prepared to face any public health challenge. With its expert guidance and collaborative approach, the EPR-TAG will play a vital role in protecting the health and well-being of millions of people across the continent.\nFor more information, please feel free to contact WHO via\neprtag\n[at]\nwho.int\n(eprtag[at]who[dot]int)\nList of the WHO AFRO Emergency Preparedness & Response Technical Advisory Group (EPR-TAG) Members\nName\nNationality\nDesignation\n1\nDeo NSHIMIRIMANA\n(EPR-TAG Chairperson)\nBurundi\nPublic Health Consultant\n2\nRebecca MARTIN\n(EPR-TAG Vice-Chairperson)\nUSA\nVice President, Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute\n3\nRick BRIGHT\nUSA\nCEO, Bright Global Health\n4\nDeoraj CAUSSY\nMauritius\nEpidemiologist, 360 Epidemiology Solutions\n5\nBernice DAHN\nLiberia\nVice President/Executive Dean, College of Health Sciences, University of Liberia\n6\nWafaa El-SADR\nEgypt\nFounder & Director, ICAP, Columbia University\n7\nNyasha GUZHA-CHANETSA\nZimbabwe\nChief State Veterinarian (Public Health & Trade Facilitation), South African Department of Agriculture, Rural Development & Environment\n8\nBanda KHALIFA\nGhana\nGlobal Health Expert and Managing Director, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Advancing Health Systems Innovations (CAdHSI)\n9\nRodrigue KOHOUN\nBenin\nPHC Technical Advisor to the Ministry of Health, Benin\n10\nAgnes MAHOMVA\nZimbabwe\nPublic Health Advisor to the President and Cabinet, Office of the President and Cabinet, Zimbabwe\n11\nBrice Wilfried BICABA\nBurkina Faso\nDirector General, Health & Public Hygiene, Ministry of Health, Burkina Faso\n12\nCheikh Tidiane MBOW\nSenegal\nChief, Health Promotion & Infectious Diseases Prevention Unit, MONUSCO (Goma",
