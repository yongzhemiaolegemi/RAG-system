It faces the highest mortality rate from antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and bears a significant burden of infectious diseases such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. Millions of people in Africa lack access to essential antibiotics, and the continent has limited laboratory capacity to detect AMR pathogens, further complicating healthcare responses. \n\nTo address these pressing health issues, multiple public health initiatives and partnerships operate across Africa. The Joint External Assessment Program (JEAP) initiative specifically targets Africa to enhance health emergency preparedness and response systems against frequent disease outbreaks and humanitarian crises. Similarly, initiatives like the Saving Lives and Livelihoods program work throughout the continent to strengthen public health systems and improve pandemic preparedness. \n\nOrganizations such as the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the African Union (AU) lead coordinated responses to combat AMR and infectious diseases, while collaborations with UNICEF focus on improving healthcare infrastructure, immunization coverage, supply chain management, and boosting local manufacturing of health commodities. These efforts also include improving regulatory frameworks and market access to enhance Africa’s capacity to manage health challenges effectively.\n\nOverall, Africa is actively seeking to enhance its self-reliance in health security through innovation, partnerships, and a shared vision for a safer and healthier future. The continent remains the primary geographic focus for these extensive health initiatives and collaborative efforts aimed at overcoming its significant health security challenges.<SEP>Africa is the continent affected by the Mpox outbreaks, hosting 15 African Union member states with reported cases in 2024 and the focus area for Africa CDC's emergency response.",

The MoU was signed by H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, and Rémi Maréchaux, Ambassador of France to Ethiopia, at a ceremony held at the Africa CDC Secretariat Offices in Addis Ababa.\nThe MoU aims to strengthen Africa CDC’s efforts to build more robust public health systems and improve health security across the continent. Key areas of collaboration under the MoU include strengthening Africa CDC’s capacity; supporting the development of national public health institutes; enhancing disease surveillance and emergency response capacities; promoting local manufacturing of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics; supporting workforce training; and fostering research partnerships between French and African institutions.\n“The signing of this MoU solidifies our shared vision in nurturing a coordinated global response to global public health challenges. This action-oriented framework aims to advance the New Public Health order, enhance health workforce development, and strengthen public health systems for the benefit of all African citizens,” said H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya at the signing ceremony.\nThis MoU builds on France’s longstanding support for public health in Africa. France played a leading role in launching the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator and has donated 10 million vaccine doses to the AVAT mechanism and 48 million doses to 40 African states, mainly through the COVAX initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. The French Development Agency provided a €50 million line of credit to Afreximbank for the AVAT payment facility, enabling vaccine purchases by Uganda, Burundi, DRC and Egypt. The AFD has committed over €500 million to health programs in Africa through its ” Santé en Commun ” (Health in Common) initiative.

This independent body serves as the principal advisory group to WHO AFRO for strategic guidance on all matters pertaining to public health emergency preparedness and response.\nThe EPR Technical Advisory Group will play a critical role in supporting WHO African Member States to fortify health security in the face of diverse emergencies. Countries in the WHO African Region experience over 100 health emergencies annually which disrupt the economy and prosperity of communities and weaken already fragile health systems. With climate change and conflict aggravating more than half of Africa’s health emergencies, the next pandemic is not just a possibility, it's imminent. It is imperative, now more than ever, to enhance the Emergency Preparedness and Response capabilities within the Region.\nComposed of 16 distinguished experts (details below) from diverse fields like epidemiology, public health, global health, vaccinology, paediatrics, nutrition, internal medicine, infectious diseases, programme management, health-care administration, health economics, health communication, sociology, the EPR-TAG advises the WHO AFRO Regional Director on key issues. These include assessing the regional context of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies; conducting horizon scanning for new and emerging threats; providing strategic guidance on preparedness, response, and recovery strategies; reviewing progress in implementing regional health security initiatives; and strengthening country ownership and decision-making in emergency response.\nThe EPR-TAG is chaired by Dr Deo Nshimirimana, a retired WHO medical doctor renowned for his expertise in immunization in emergency settings. Assisting him is Dr Rebecca Martin, Vice President of Global Health and Director of the Emory Global Health Institute, appointed as the Vice-Chairperson. Dr Martin brings decades of experience in health security, emergency response and immunization. Both leaders bring a wealth of experience in public health and will guide the EPR-TAG for an initial three-year term. \"The opportunity to lead the EPR",

The Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative, a bold and unprecedented $1.5 billion partnership, was launched in June 2021. This innovative and ground-breaking partnership aimed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, roll out vaccinations, build the vaccine manufacturing workforce for the continent, and strengthen the Africa CDC to ensure long-term health security for Africa.\nUnprecedented in scale, speed and inclusion of African organisations, the partnership has\ncontributed to the continent’s current vaccination rate of 53 per cent of\nthe target population, up from just 3 per cent at the start of the initiative. The partnership has also trained, equipped, and deployed 38,000 health workers, creating a robust frontline in safeguarding public health locally. It has provided job opportunities for 23,000 individuals and integrated over 600 COVID-19 vaccination centres into healthcare systems. Additionally, this initiative led to the expansion of genomic testing capabilities from seven to 40 laboratories across the continent.\nThe review of Phase 1 of this initiative, among fifteen implementing partners across 29 countries, conducted by Deloitte, indicates that the vast majority of funds disbursed were used effectively and as intended. Likewise, ongoing monitoring by KPMG has confirmed that partners not only showed strength in programmatic results but also improved the institutional capacity for greater sustainability and institutional resilience.\n“Our Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative with the Mastercard Foundation has shown the power of respectful and action-oriented partnerships rooted in collaboration, coordination and systems strengthening. The experience and learnings from Phase I will enable us to move with greater speed and scale to deliver with accelerated impact to our member states” said\nDr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC\n.\nIn its second",

These initiatives, co-funded by the European Union, are poised to fortify the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative (Africa PGI 2.0), enhancing the capacity of member states for molecular detection of outbreaks, AMR genomic surveillance, and timely data sharing across Africa.\nThe kick-off meeting, convened at the Africa CDC Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, signified a pivotal moment in the collaboration between the African CDC and the European Commission Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen outbreak detection and disease surveillance throughout Africa.\nThrough these projects implemented by the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HaDEA), Africa CDC, and HERA, in partnership with African Union (AU) Member States, the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) and the Africa Public Health Foundation (APHF), will strengthen national and regional capacities to promptly detect outbreaks, support the integration of AMR genomic surveillance, and facilitate swift and high-quality data sharing for public health decision-making.\nHis Excellency Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of the Africa CDC, emphasized the significance of this partnership stating, “The increasing number of outbreaks is driven by complex ecological, climatic, political, economic, and social factors, all of which are becoming more exacerbated on our continent. These projects are poised to strengthen laboratory detection and surveillance of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic diseases, as well as antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Africa. They also highlight the strategic partnership between Africa CDC and the European Commission.”\nLaurent Muschel, Acting Director General of HERA, emphasized, “In the face of ongoing global health challenges, Africa CDC and HERA are taking together concrete actions to strengthen detection of outbreaks, AMR genomic surveillance, and timely data sharing across Africa. Fortifying multi-pathogen molecular detection and sequencing capabilities in the African Union is essential for global health security.”\nAfrica CDC’s shift towards Africa PGI 2.0 signifies a transition from emergency response to building an optimized, resilient, and integrated molecular diagnostic and genomic surveillance ecosystem. It is critical and timely to incorporate lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, and empower national and regional reference laboratories to expand their capabilities to detect and characterize epidemic and pandemic-prone diseases. As demonstrated in previous outbreaks, molecular detection and genomic sequencing improves early detection and response to public health emergencies. Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, CEO of ASLM, remarked, “The launch of the two projects is pivotal in devising scalable and sustainable approaches for integrating molecular diagnostics and sequencing within Africa’s routine surveillance structures. We are eager to collaborate with the Africa CDC and HERA to strengthen laboratory systems ensuring effective responses to current and future health threats”.\n“APHF will continue to strengthen collaboration with the Africa CDC and HERA to support the flagship Pathogen Genomics Initiative (Africa PGI) and advance public health laboratory systems for pandemic preparedness and response.” Said Dr. Ebere Okereke, CEO of APHF\nThe Africa CDC is working with ASLM, APHF, Member States, the Africa Laboratory Technical Working Group, and other partners to ensure the effective and successful implementation of the two projects.\n# #\nFor more information:\nDr. Sofonias Tessema, Program Lead, Africa PGI |Africa CDC| sofoniast@africacdc.org\nMedia inquiries:\nMs. Margaret Muigai Edwin,\nDirector, Communication & Public Information Directorate: Africa CDC |\nTel: +255 742 635 592 | Email:\nedwinm@africacdc.org\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is the continental autonomous Health agency of the African Union that strengthens the capacity and capability of Africa’s public health institutions as well as partnerships to detect and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats and outbreaks, based on data-driven interventions and programmes.

CEPI stands ready to support Africa CDC in the realisation of these goals and to further strengthen Africa’s preparedness and resilience against future outbreaks.”\nIn line with the African Union’s (A.U.) ambition to produce 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs in Africa by 2040 under the Africa CDC’s Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM);  the expanded partnership will ultimately focus its efforts on enhancing research and development, building a workforce as well as supply chain optimization to support resilient health systems This ambition will increase vaccine sovereignty and reduce external reliance, helping prevent a recurrence of the vaccine inequity seen during the COVID-19 response in Africa.\nTo boost vaccine accessibility and efficiency and meet this goal, there is a need to invest in vaccine R&D and manufacturing innovations, amongst others, and build a resilient regional supply chain. To that end, Africa CDC and CEPI will coordinate to fund innovations accelerating speed, scale, or accessibility for initial implementation with African manufacturers. This investment will support sustainable manufacturing for routine vaccinations in Africa, and—in the event of an outbreak—these facilities can be mobilized to produce response vaccines promptly.\nIn alignment with Africa CDC, the partnership also aims to bolster Africa’s research ecosystem and clinical trial infrastructure, including targeted capacity strengthening through CEPI’s\nResearch Preparedness Program",

The equipment was procured and delivered through the support of UNICEF, one of the initiative’s implementing partners. The support aligns with the Africa CDC goal of strengthening healthcare systems and enhancing the response to vaccine-preventable diseases.\nThe cumulative equipment across the five (5) Member States, which consists of 465 refrigerators and freezers, 1,150 temperature monitors, 5,253 vaccine carriers and cold boxes, and 2 cold rooms, all valued up to USD 3.3 million, will significantly enhance the healthcare infrastructure and capabilities. The equipment is designed to efficiently manage vaccines and vital medical supplies, supporting the expansion of COVID-19 vaccination and other programs, including routine Immunization, which aims to ensure safe and effective vaccines reach every child. By expanding the cold chain storage capacity, the Ministries of Health will be able to offer a more comprehensive vaccination program and improve vaccine coverage rates.\nH.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, the Africa CDC Director General, emphasizes the significant benefits of this equipment in minimizing vaccine wastage due to temperature fluctuations. “This optimization allows the Ministries of Health to allocate healthcare budgets more effectively and allocate resources to other critical areas of healthcare. The availability of CCE facilitates extensive immunization activities, reaching remote and underserved communities. This, in turn, leads to improved vaccine coverage rates, reducing the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases, including COVID-19, and strengthening health security in Africa towards attaining global health security,” Dr Kaseya said.\nThe provision of Cold Chain Equipment is crucial in preserving vaccines and maintaining the efficacy of temperature-sensitive medical supplies. The addition of freezers and refrigerators enables member states to store a wider range of vaccines, including those requiring ultra-low temperatures like COVID-19. This expansion of cold chain storage is essential to pandemic preparedness and will enable member states to offer more comprehensive vaccination programs.\nThe cold boxes and vaccine carriers provide reliable transportation while maintaining the recommended vaccine temperature, ensuring vaccine efficacy and safety. This feature increases geographic coverage and contributes to improved immunization service delivery and health security in Africa by enhancing the capacity of Ministries of Health to manage vaccines and strengthen their cold chain systems.\nDuring the handover ceremony in Zambia, the Honorable Sylvia Masebo, the Minister of Health of the Republic of Zambia, highlighted that the support from Afric a CDC aligns with Zambia’s goals to have readily available life-saving vaccines and strengthened cold chain capacity, and the Ministry will seek more equipment to build on the gains made, while implementing the integration of COVID-19 vaccines into primary healthcare services.\nThe Africa CDC, Mastercard Foundation, and UNICEF anticipate the successful installation and efficient use of these CCEs in healthcare facilities, positively catalyzing and strengthening the healthcare landscape in the Member States. With this support, the Ministries of Health are better positioned to respond effectively to public health emergencies, ensuring equitable access to vaccines and treatments. The support provided by the Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation demonstrates their commitment to strengthening healthcare systems in Africa. It underscores the importance of collective collaboration in addressing global health challenges and ensuring vaccine equity for Africa.\nFor more information:\nDr Merawi Aragaw| Head of Division for",
