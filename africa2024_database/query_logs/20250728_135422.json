Its primary mission is to enhance disease surveillance, outbreak response, and emergency preparedness to detect, prevent, control, and manage health threats throughout the continent. As a leading public health institution in Africa, Africa CDC plays a central role in building health security and coordinating regional responses to infectious disease epidemics, including mpox, by collaborating closely with African governments and global partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union, and Gavi.\n\nAfrica CDC actively co-leads initiatives like the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to address disease outbreaks and public health emergencies, while providing technical support, capacity building, and epidemic response coordination. The agency emphasizes genomic surveillance strategies as part of its comprehensive approach to managing public health challenges and strengthening health systems continent-wide.\n\nIn addition to its role in disease control, Africa CDC leads and supports critical vaccine manufacturing initiatives, including the African Vaccine Manufacturing Alliance (AVMA), with the goal of increasing local production to meet 60% of Africa’s demand for vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics by 2040. The agency promotes sustainable vaccine development, regulatory harmonization, decentralization of diagnostics, and localization of health product manufacturing to build resilient and self-sufficient health systems.\n\nOperating under the African Union's Agenda 2063 and guided by a strategic plan for 2023-2027, Africa CDC strives to enhance health sovereignty, improve health outcomes, strengthen emergency response capabilities, and foster knowledge-sharing and institutional strengthening across African countries. Through these efforts, Africa CDC empowers Africa’s health security and advances the continent’s ability to manage current and future public health threats effectively.",

            "description": "Mpox, also known as monkeypox, is a viral infectious disease endemic to 12 African countries, primarily in Central and West Africa, where it causes recurring epidemics. The disease is characterized by high transmissibility, significant mortality rates, and considerable social and economic impacts. Since 2022, there has been an increase in case numbers and deaths associated with Mpox. The disease poses severe health risks, including the potential for vertical transmission and severe infections particularly affecting children and people living with HIV. Due to limited availability of vaccines and medical countermeasures, Mpox has driven ongoing research, surveillance, preparedness, and response activities. Addressing Mpox requires multi-sectoral health security measures and cross-border public health coordination to effectively manage outbreaks and reduce its burden in affected regions.",

The equipment was procured and delivered through the support of UNICEF, one of the initiative’s implementing partners. The support aligns with the Africa CDC goal of strengthening healthcare systems and enhancing the response to vaccine-preventable diseases.\nThe cumulative equipment across the five (5) Member States, which consists of 465 refrigerators and freezers, 1,150 temperature monitors, 5,253 vaccine carriers and cold boxes, and 2 cold rooms, all valued up to USD 3.3 million, will significantly enhance the healthcare infrastructure and capabilities. The equipment is designed to efficiently manage vaccines and vital medical supplies, supporting the expansion of COVID-19 vaccination and other programs, including routine Immunization, which aims to ensure safe and effective vaccines reach every child. By expanding the cold chain storage capacity, the Ministries of Health will be able to offer a more comprehensive vaccination program and improve vaccine coverage rates.\nH.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, the Africa CDC Director General, emphasizes the significant benefits of this equipment in minimizing vaccine wastage due to temperature fluctuations. “This optimization allows the Ministries of Health to allocate healthcare budgets more effectively and allocate resources to other critical areas of healthcare. The availability of CCE facilitates extensive immunization activities, reaching remote and underserved communities. This, in turn, leads to improved vaccine coverage rates, reducing the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases, including COVID-19, and strengthening health security in Africa towards attaining global health security,” Dr Kaseya said.\nThe provision of Cold Chain Equipment is crucial in preserving vaccines and maintaining the efficacy of temperature-sensitive medical supplies. The addition of freezers and refrigerators enables member states to store a wider range of vaccines, including those requiring ultra-low temperatures like COVID-19. This expansion of cold chain storage is essential to pandemic preparedness and will enable member states to offer more comprehensive vaccination programs.\nThe cold boxes and vaccine carriers provide reliable transportation while maintaining the recommended vaccine temperature, ensuring vaccine efficacy and safety. This feature increases geographic coverage and contributes to improved immunization service delivery and health security in Africa by enhancing the capacity of Ministries of Health to manage vaccines and strengthen their cold chain systems.\nDuring the handover ceremony in Zambia, the Honorable Sylvia Masebo, the Minister of Health of the Republic of Zambia, highlighted that the support from Afric a CDC aligns with Zambia’s goals to have readily available life-saving vaccines and strengthened cold chain capacity, and the Ministry will seek more equipment to build on the gains made, while implementing the integration of COVID-19 vaccines into primary healthcare services.\nThe Africa CDC, Mastercard Foundation, and UNICEF anticipate the successful installation and efficient use of these CCEs in healthcare facilities, positively catalyzing and strengthening the healthcare landscape in the Member States. With this support, the Ministries of Health are better positioned to respond effectively to public health emergencies, ensuring equitable access to vaccines and treatments. The support provided by the Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation demonstrates their commitment to strengthening healthcare systems in Africa. It underscores the importance of collective collaboration in addressing global health challenges and ensuring vaccine equity for Africa.\nFor more information:\nDr Merawi Aragaw| Head of Division for Surveillance and Disease Intelligence | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: merawia@africa-union.org| M: +251912611294 Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nFor media inquiry:\nFor media enquiries please contact:\nDorothy Njagi\n| Senior Communication Officer- Communication & Public Information directorate | Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention| African Union| email: email:\nnjagid@africacdc.org\n| Website: www.africacdc.org| Addis Ababa| Ethiopia|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous Public Health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

The collaboration builds on the 2022-2024 Partnership Framework Agreement between Africa CDC and UNICEF, which aims to achieve the goals outlined in the African Union Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership is expected to have a significant impact on public health in Africa by strengthening procurement and supply chain systems, with a particular focus on immunisation for children across the continent.\nH.E Dr Jean Kaseya, Director General of Africa CDC, and Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations, signed the expanded partnership agreement in Addis Ababa.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of many healthcare systems and highlighted deficiencies and challenges in medical supply chains. While countries with strong primary healthcare systems were better able to cope, the disruption caused by the pandemic left others facing shortages of vital medical commodities. Over the next four years, Africa CDC and UNICEF will work together to establish robust institutional backing for supply chain management and enhance pooled procurement mechanisms to fortify Africa’s healthcare infrastructure, ensuring timely and adequate access to essential medical supplies for its population.\nH.E Jean Kaseya expressed his pride in the partnership with UNICEF, stating that their shared commitments will enhance primary healthcare and strengthen Africa’s health security. ‘‘The partnership will optimise supply chain management, operationalise the pool procurement mechanism for Africa CDC, empower community health workers, and advance local manufacturing. Ultimately, these efforts will strengthen immunisation systems and reduce outbreaks and epidemics on the continent’’, he says.\nImmunisation is one of the most effective public health interventions globally. However, millions of children in Africa are still deprived of life-saving vaccinations.\nUNICEF’s The State of the World’s Children\n2023: For Every Child\n, Vaccination report revealed that 12.7 million children were under-vaccinated in 2021, including 8.7 million who did not receive a single dose, also called “zero-dose” children.\n“This partnership is a commitment to the well-being of children and their families, affirming their right to health. By strengthening our partnership with Africa CDC and the Joint Emergency Action Plan for Africa, we can ensure communities get the support they need without delay,” said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations. “The push forward on paid and protected community health workers, medical supplies made in Africa, for Africans, remains one of our highest priorities.”\nDuring the past two years, UNICEF and Africa CDC have achieved significant milestones in strengthening Africa CDC’s institutional capacity and catalysing community health programmes, immunisation systems, emergency response, and supply chain enhancement. Collaborative efforts secured the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses and essential cold chain equipment for routine immunisation. Joint high-level advocacy initiatives focused on immunisation, community health, and response to public health emergencies.\nAfrica imports 99% of its vaccines and 70 to 90% of its medicines and medical devices, which is a significant challenge. Africa CDC aims to achieve sustainable production and supply of essential health commodities through African manufacturers, considered Africa’s second independence by Africa CDC. Africa CDC’s goal is to work with African Union Member States and partners to actively advocate for and support the procurement of vaccines made in Africa and prioritise initiatives that strengthen local manufacturing.\nThrough the Partnership for Vaccine Manufacturing, Africa CDC aims to manufacture 60% of the continent’s vaccine needs by 2040, paving the way toward robust and self-reliant health systems, ensuring that people can obtain and use health commodities when and where required.\nThe expanded partnership between Africa CDC and UNICEF signifies a concerted effort to address Africa’s pressing health challenges. By prioritising immunisation, strengthening health systems, and promoting local production, both organisations are poised to make tangible and sustainable impacts on the health and well-being of children and communities across the continent while safeguarding Africa’s health security.\n#  #\nAbout the Partnership\nThe Africa CDC and UNICEF Partnership Framework Agreement, commenced in 2022 and extended today to 2027, contributes to the goals and objective of Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The partnership framework outlines three programmatic areas of collaboration: (i) public health emergency preparedness and response; (ii) immunization systems strengthening; and (iii) procurement and supply chain systems strengthening. Under the partnership extension, this collaboration will expand, particularly in the areas of system strengthening for primary health care (including community health and nutrition systems), in supply chain management, regional and pooled procurement, manufacturing and emergency preparedness and response.\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

This renders antibiotics and other antimicrobials less effective, causing treatment failures, increased disease spread, severe illness, disability and higher mortality rates.\nDespite the estimated USD2-6 billion needed annually for an effective AMR response across Africa, current funding is only a tenth of that allocated to other major diseases. This underfunding makes AMR a significant barrier to sustainable development, hindering progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.\nAn estimated 700,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections globally. Without timely intervention, this number is projected to reach 10 million by 2050, with Africa accounting for 4.5 million.\n“Fighting disease requires resources and working with member states and our partners we need to do all we can to save lives,” said Dr Tajudeen, speaking at the launch of a report on AMR in Africa. The event also initiated discussions on a roadmap and targets to advance Africa’s battle against AMR. The outcomes are expected to inform the upcoming United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting in September—a crucial platform for global action on this escalating crisis.\nDr Huyam Salih, the director of the African Union-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), emphasized the critical role that the AU must play in combating AMR. “Antimicrobial resistance is not just a health issue—it is a threat to our agrifood systems, food safety, food security, livelihoods, and economies,” she said.\nBy 2050, global healthcare costs could exceed USD1 trillion per year, and livestock production could decline by 2.6% to 7.5% annually due to AMR, according to Dr Salih. “In Africa, the situation is particularly alarming, with 37 countries reporting the prevalence of AMR in animal farms, yet only 16% of African countries are conducting routine AMR surveillance in animals as of 2023,” she said.\nDr Salih also called for urgent action to strengthen leadership, expand surveillance and data systems, promote the responsible use of antimicrobials, improve public and animal health systems, and secure sustainable financing to combat AMR effectively. “Our health, our food, and our future depend on the actions we take now,” she stressed.\nDr Tajudeen said addressing AMR in Africa requires engaging all levels of society in a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach. “Unless we work together, overcoming antimicrobial resistance will be a difficult and long-drawn process that will cost lives,” he said.\nCurrently, millions in Africa lack access to essential antibiotics, with a study by Africa CDC and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine revealing that only 1.3% of microbiology labs in 14 member states can test for key AMR pathogens.\nThe head of the African Society for Laboratory Medicine, Mr. Nqobile Ndlovu, reaffirmed the organization’s commitment to strengthening African laboratory capacities to combat antimicrobial resistance. “Our goal is to ensure the continued efficacy of treatments and promote data-driven solutions to safeguard public health across the continent,” he said.\nDr Tajudeen underscored the importance of prioritizing infection prevention, strengthening health and food systems, developing human resources, ensuring sustainable access to diagnostics and therapeutics, and investing in laboratory infrastructure for effective surveillance and data generation.\nThe report recommends an increase in the availability of high-quality diagnostics, vaccines, and antimicrobials for high-priority pathogens in high-risk African countries.\nFor more information\n:\nMedia inquiries:\nMargaret Edwin,\nDirector of Communication & Public Information Division: Africa CDC | Tel: +251 986 632 878 | Email:\nEdwinM@africacdc.org\nAbout Africa CDC\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is a continental autonomous public health agency of the African Union that supports member states in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.

The AU delegation was led by the AUC, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD). The EU delegation was led by the Belgian Presidency of the European Council and the European Commission.\nBuilding on the health commitments of the 6th EU-AU Summit and outcomes of the Addis Ababa AU-EU High-level dialogue, the AU and EU expanded collaboration in priority areas of common interest in the New Public Health Order and the EU Global Health Strategy, such as strengthening pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health, AMR, digital health, climate and health. This collaboration is a positive example of the AU-EU partnership to support global health in multilateral fora. Enhancing equitable access to safe, qualitive, effective and affordable health services and products and national sovereignty will be key to reach SDG-targets such as achieving Universal Health Coverage. Therefore, it is crucial to support social protection systems which incorporate social health protection, aiming at gradually granting universal health coverage as well as at providing income security in case of sickness. The AU and EU further stressed the importance of the health sector in the creation of jobs and growth. They also expressed their commitment to conclude negotiations on a pandemic agreement and International Health Regulations by the May 2024 World Health Assembly.\nMost African countries are struggling to ensure sustainable and equitable access to the health products needed to meet the continent’s priority health needs. At the same time, the EU has expertise in health as well as manufacturing and access, including regulation of health products and has set out clear targets in supporting human development in its international partnerships.\nWith this High-level conference, the EU engages in continued technical collaboration on health in Africa and investments in strengthening Africa’s health security architecture. The EU’s Global Gateway strategy will be key to deliver on these commitments, notably through Team Europe Initiatives, increasing the resilience of European and African health systems in response to the rapidly shifting health burden, social protection, the impact of climate change and emerging health threats while considering innovative science, sharing of technical expertise and knowledge (as well as multi-stakeholder commitments).\nThe Belgian Presidency and the European Commission will follow up on the high-level conference in the European Council and in the governing bodies of the EU’s international cooperation instruments, aligned with shared interests and ambitions of European and African partners.\nAfrican Union Commissioner for Health, Humanitarian Affairs and Social Development,\nH.E. Amb. Minata Samate Cessouma\n“\nThe establishment of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) marks a crucial step forward in safeguarding health security on the continent by ensuring the availability and the accessibility of quality pharmaceutical products. This availability and accessibility facilitate prevention strategies and rapid responses to health emergencies, strengthening regulatory capacities and promoting regional cooperation and harmonisation of standards. By harmonising regulatory processes and promoting access to effectual medical products, the AMA can significantly enhance public health outcomes and promote sustainable development in Africa, as envisioned in the Africa Health Strategy (2016-2030) and the African Union Agenda 2063. AMA is also envisioned to bolster research and development efforts within the continent, fostering innovation and self-reliance in addressing health challenges specific to the continent. Looking to the future, the African Union Commission is enthusiastic about knowledge-sharing between the European Union and Africa to leverage the experience of establishing the European Mediines Agency to chart guidance and regulatory pathways for the development and approval of new manufacturing technologies and processes.\nBelgian Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities,\nH.E. Caroline GENNEZ\n“\nThe EU and Africa express a shared vision of health as the precondition for social development. African countries have extensive experience in the containment of epidemics; European countries have some of the best and most accessible healthcare in the world. Global health is an area in which the EU offers added value as a partner to Africa based on its expertise and experience. Europe bolsters its international partnerships by focusing on its unique selling proposition. Our cooperation on this front will improve health outcomes for countless of people, in Africa and Europe. Our focus will be on building affordable, available and high-quality healthcare systems.\n”\nEuropean Commissioner for International Partnerships,\nH.E. Jutta URPILAINEN\n“\nLearning the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, the AU and the EU are committed to advance health systems and strengthen health capacities globally. This joint commitment was well reflected in the Global Gateway investment package, which we presented at the AU-EU Summit of 2022. We are proud of the results achieved in increasing local manufacturing of medicines and vaccines in Africa, for Africa. Today we launch three major Team Europe Initiatives on health security, digital health and public health institutes, and strengthen cooperation between our institutions. This is another step forward to better confront evolving health challenges and to enhance the resilience of our communities.\n”\nEuropean Commissioner for Health and Food Safety,\nH.E. Stella KYRIAKIDES\n“\nAn ever-closer partnership between the African Union and the European Union is indispensable for public health. We want to work more closely with our African partners on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health and anti-microbial resistance, as well as the health effects of climate change. These are core objectives for our EU Global Health Strategy and the foundations of our cooperation with the African continent. We are now at a critical stage of the negotiations on the",

Under a transformative initiative, the Organization has embarked on a mission to establish three emergency hubs in the region.\nThe WHO Regional Emergency Hub in Dakar launched today is the second of its kind after WHO and the Government of Kenya launched the Nairobi health emergency hub in 2022. A health emergency hub in Pretoria is planned to be launched in 2024.\n“This hub, with its various functions that include strategic pre-positioning of emergency health supplies, will enable the WHO Regional Office for Africa to support countries affected by health or humanitarian crises respond faster and in a more structured manner,” said Amadou Ba, Prime Minister of Senegal.\nThe African region faces the highest number of health emergencies globally each year. As of November 2023, the region was grappling with more than 130 disease outbreaks. In West Africa’s Sahel region, more than 33 million people across six countries currently require urgent need of life-saving humanitarian assistance.\nThe goal of the regional emergency hubs is to substantially reduce – from an average of 45 days previously to three days – the time it takes to deliver life-saving, effective emergency response to countries after a public health event has been declared. This is critical to make meaningful difference in the plight of people affected by crises and to effectively control and end disease outbreaks.\nThe health emergency hubs also serve as centres of excellence, aiming to train more than 3000 African experts, equipping them with key technical skills essential for effective response to health emergencies. Each of the three centres has a specialized function, capitalizing on the comparative advantages afforded by each host country.\n“I extend my heartfelt appreciation to all those who have contributed to establishing this essential facility,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Our work through this hub aligns with the current global dynamic towards emergency preparedness, vaccine manufacturing, supply chain and effective tools to better respond to public health crises.”\nThe Senegal hub specializes in supply chain management, data analysis, innovation and information management, the Kenya hub focuses on the development of emergency medical personnel, while that in south Africa specializes on research and development, and genomic surveillance.\nSince September 2022 when the temporary warehouse in Nairobi became operational the delivery time of critical emergency health supplies and equipment within the region has drastically reduced from at least three weeks to an average of three days. The deployment of responders has also been reduced.\nThe Government of Senegal has allocated five hectares of land for the construction of the Regional Emergency Hub in the outskirts of Dakar. The 8000-square-metre building has a 100-person office space. Additionally, the government has allocated 5000-square-metre container yard and is facilitating speedy custom clearance processes for inbound and outbound supplies.\nThe hubs in Kenya and Senegal feature a warehouse for prepositioning medical supplies and equipment, a state-of-the-art training facility, an infectious diseases unit, an emergency response simulation facility and a training camp for health emergency first responders.\nThe Regional Emergency Hubs will work in close cooperation with partners and the broader United Nations ecosystem to support countries. WHO is also collaborating closely with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to strengthen emergency preparedness and response and health systems on the continent.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)",

Its mission is to safeguard Africa’s health security and accelerate the achievement of universal health coverage.\nAfrica CDC’s strategic focus is on three critical priorities: (1) outbreak and pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response; (2) health systems strengthening, with an emphasis on primary health care and community health; and (3) effective local manufacturing of health commodities, including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.\nAfrica CDC recognizes Gavi as a pivotal partner for health security and collective resilience to vaccine-preventable diseases across the continent. Indeed, from 2000 to 2022, Gavi invested US$11.9 billion to enhance access to life-saving vaccines in Africa, resulting in 11.1 million future deaths averted in Africa.\nThis week, the Gavi Board approved the Gavi Alliance’s new five-year strategy (2026-2030), focusing on accelerating vaccine coverage, introducing new vaccines, strengthening health systems for equity, and supporting global health security and regional vaccine manufacturing. As a public-private partnership, Gavi is funded through replenishment events hosted by donor governments to mobilize support from governments, philanthropies, the private sector, various institutions, civil society organizations, and individuals.In a show of commitment and support as the continent is the primary beneficiary of Gavi funds, Africa CDC and the African Union and African member states stand ready to fully support the 2024 replenishment event hosted by France in Paris on June 20th.\nThis 2024 replenishment meeting will be unique, highlighting Gavi’s support for Africa’s crucial agenda of local manufacturing, as endorsed by African Heads of State under the Africa CDC’s Platform for Harmonized Health Manufacturing in Africa (PHAHM). Indeed, Gavi will unveil a groundbreaking US$1 billion commitment over ten years through a new initiative called the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), aimed at bolstering African health security and sovereignty. At the Gavi Board meeting on June 7th, the Director General of Africa CDC, H.E. Dr Jean Kaseya, underscored the importance of respectful partnership and collaboration, stating, “Local manufacturing is the second independence of Africa because it impacts our health security and economic growth.\nAdditionally, Africa CDC will spearhead the Lusaka agenda to strengthen national leadership and partner coordination for effective implementation of the One Plan, One Budget, and One M&E Framework.\n“In recognition of AVMA’s significance to Africa, Dr. Kaseya announced that the popular launch of AVMA will occur on African soil in the coming weeks. This momentous occasion will bring together African leaders, Gavi, donors and partners, African Civil Society Organizations, and communities to reflect on and celebrate the journey toward Africa’s self-reliance in manufacturing vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.Together, we stand on the brink of a new era for Africa’s self-reliance in health security, driven by innovation, partnership, and a shared vision for a safer, healthier, and more prosperous Africa.\nAbout Africa CDC:\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (AfricaCDC) is the African Union’s continental autonomous public health agency that supports member states in strengthening health systems and improving surveillance, emergency response, and prevention and control of diseases.
