Its primary mission is to enhance disease surveillance, outbreak response, and emergency preparedness to detect, prevent, control, and manage health threats throughout the continent. As a leading public health institution in Africa, Africa CDC plays a central role in building health security and coordinating regional responses to infectious disease epidemics, including mpox, by collaborating closely with African governments and global partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union, and Gavi.\n\nAfrica CDC actively co-leads initiatives like the Joint Emergency Preparedness and Response Action Plan (JEAP) to address disease outbreaks and public health emergencies, while providing technical support, capacity building, and epidemic response coordination. The agency emphasizes genomic surveillance strategies as part of its comprehensive approach to managing public health challenges and strengthening health systems continent-wide.\n\nIn addition to its role in disease control, Africa CDC leads and supports critical vaccine manufacturing initiatives, including the African Vaccine Manufacturing Alliance (AVMA), with the goal of increasing local production to meet 60% of Africa’s demand for vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics by 2040. The agency promotes sustainable vaccine development, regulatory harmonization, decentralization of diagnostics, and localization of health product manufacturing to build resilient and self-sufficient health systems.\n\nOperating under the African Union's Agenda 2063 and guided by a strategic plan for 2023-2027, Africa CDC strives to enhance health sovereignty, improve health outcomes, strengthen emergency response capabilities, and foster knowledge-sharing and institutional strengthening across African countries. Through these efforts, Africa CDC empowers Africa’s health security and advances the continent’s ability to manage current and future public health threats effectively.",

The United Kingdom’s dedication to addressing the world’s most pressing health challenges through research, development, and collaboration is both commendable and inspiring.\nThe allocation of the United Kingdom’s investment of £95 million in tackling deadly diseases in Africa Programme II, will foster partnerships with countries and Africa-based organizations — Africa CDC and WHO — to detect and address future epidemics, combat drug-resistant infections, and address climate-related health challenges. Such collaborative efforts are essential in building stronger health systems and ensuring a more secure future for all.\nWe also commend the allocation of up to £103.5 million for the development of affordable vaccines and health products, along with initiatives to combat the spread of infectious diseases, particularly during pandemics, as a demonstration of the United Kingdom’s leadership in the field of global health. This investment will undoubtedly contribute to safeguarding the health and well-being of populations worldwide, preventing future outbreaks, and ultimately saving lives.\nThe commitment to protecting women’s sexual and reproductive health is a crucial step towards achieving a more equitable and inclusive world. By reducing preventable deaths and improving access to care, the United Kingdom is actively working to realize the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063 in promoting the well-being of all, regardless of geographic location.\nThe United Kingdom’s support for research and development in low- and middle-income countries, including advancements in drug administration methods, showcases a commitment to reaching even the most remote areas with life-saving care. This approach aligns with the principles of inclusivity and resilience that are fundamental to the global health agenda.\nThe commitment to health security by the United Kingdom through international development is evident in its track record of investing in research, development, and healthcare infrastructure. The impact of these efforts, from malaria treatments to diagnostics for drug-resistant tuberculosis, has been significant and has undoubtedly saved countless lives.\nWe would like to express our deep appreciation for the United Kingdom’s resolute dedication to advancing global health. Their commitment to research, innovation, and international cooperation increases optimism for a healthier and more prosperous world.\nWe look forward to continued collaboration and progress in achieving our shared global health objectives.\nH.E.

Low health investment and limited prioritization of the health workforce have critically exposed health systems. Investment in health, especially from domestic sources, is still low and inadequate for many countries to meet the universal health coverage and ensure health security\n“The numbers of Africans who have left the continent in search of greener pastures in other parts of the world are staggering. It is a matter that needs to be addressed as a top priority for African governments and indeed all those who wish to see a shift in the historical as well as current trends,” said Honourable Dr Kalumbi Shangula, Minister of Health and Social Services of Namibia.\nThe charter launched today brought together the health workforce investment efforts of all stakeholders, including national governments, the private health sector, civil society, external financing institutions and development partners in Africa.\n“By investing in the health workforce, we not only address the challenges within the sector but also generate dividends in education, employment and gender equality,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “These investments will contribute to our sustained efforts in attracting more resources and improving the quality of our health workforce.”\nInvesting in the health workforce will have positive spin-offs in the form of decent jobs, particularly for women and youth who often face barriers to employment. By providing opportunities for education, training and career progression, the Charter will immensely contribute to the economic empowerment of these demographics and fundamentally support inclusive economic growth.\nAdditionally, health labour force investment also brings multiple returns for health and economies, increasing life expectancy and job creation, while accelerating countries towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage.\nFor every US$1 invested in health and sustaining the jobs of health workers, the potential return is as much as US$9. It has also been demonstrated that half of all economic growth globally over the past decade resulted from improvements in health, and that for every added year of life expectancy, the economic growth rate is boosted by 4%.\n“Studies show that investments in the health sector yield substantial economic returns, estimating a nine-to-one return on investment. The new narrative that we are promoting is to transform the health sector to move from liability to an asset for the economy of our countries,” said Dr Jean Kaseya, Director-General of the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter was inaugurated in Namibia during the Health Workforce Investment Forum being held from 6 to 8 May 2024. Efforts will continue to be made to engage multisectoral stakeholders and partners on their experiences and achievements, and mobilize commitments, partnerships and investments to deliver on the principles and actions enshrined in the investment charter.\nClick image to enlarge\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail:\nboakyeagyemangc\n[at]\nwho.int\n(boakyeagyemangc[at]who[dot]int)",

The agreement was signed by H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, and Jutta Urpilainen, European Commissioner for International Partnerships, during the Global Gateway Forum in Brussels on October 25-26. This agreement complements the Team Europe Initiative on Manufacturing and Access to Vaccines, Medicines, and Health Technologies (TEI MAV+) for Africa.\nThe MAV+ initiative of Team Europe partners with African nations to strengthen local pharmaceutical manufacturing. It aims to improve access to quality health products, aligning with UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.8. The Global Gateway Forum brings together global leaders to promote infrastructure investment for Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, the European Union is contributing €134 million to support sustainable implementation of national plans in six African countries, fostering local manufacturing and equitable access to health products. These efforts align with the shared development objectives and geopolitical priorities of both the European Union and the African Union, complementing existing initiatives such as the African Union-European Union Innovation Agenda, the Africa CDC-PAVM Initiative, the EU Global Health Strategy, and Global Gateway.\nJutta Urpilainen, European Commissioner for International Partnerships, stated, “With its Global Health Strategy, the EU is committed to strengthening health systems and securing global chains around the world, while boosting our partners’ strategic autonomy, promoting universal health coverage, and preventing future health emergencies. These additional Global Gateway support measures will bring in more actors from the private sector and civil society. Notably, they provide targeted support to our African partners in building capacities of local production of pharmaceuticals and medical technology.”\nThe key objectives of this initiative encompass skills development through higher education and vocational training, promoting the sustainability of the private sector, fostering local ecosystems, supporting entrepreneurs and SMEs, ensuring quality assurance along national supply chains, facilitating research and development (R&D) for new or improved health products, promoting technology transfer with a focus on local organisations and shared African and European interests, strengthening regulatory processes at the country level in coordination with regional actions involving the European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO, AUDA-NEPAD, and the African Medicines Agency (AMA), driving innovation and digitalisation to enhance access to medicines, and enhancing managerial skills, country leadership, and ownership.\nH.E. Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, expressed, “The signing of this agreement solidifies our shared vision in nurturing a coordinated global response to global public health challenges. This action-oriented partnership aims to advance the New Public Health order and expand local manufacturing in Africa.”\nAbout Africa CDC\n: Africa CDC is an autonomous health agency of the African Union which supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen health systems and improve surveillance, emergency response, prevention and control of diseases.

The MoU was signed by H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director-General of Africa CDC, and Rémi Maréchaux, Ambassador of France to Ethiopia, at a ceremony held at the Africa CDC Secretariat Offices in Addis Ababa.\nThe MoU aims to strengthen Africa CDC’s efforts to build more robust public health systems and improve health security across the continent. Key areas of collaboration under the MoU include strengthening Africa CDC’s capacity; supporting the development of national public health institutes; enhancing disease surveillance and emergency response capacities; promoting local manufacturing of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics; supporting workforce training; and fostering research partnerships between French and African institutions.\n“The signing of this MoU solidifies our shared vision in nurturing a coordinated global response to global public health challenges. This action-oriented framework aims to advance the New Public Health order, enhance health workforce development, and strengthen public health systems for the benefit of all African citizens,” said H.E Dr. Jean Kaseya at the signing ceremony.\nThis MoU builds on France’s longstanding support for public health in Africa. France played a leading role in launching the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator and has donated 10 million vaccine doses to the AVAT mechanism and 48 million doses to 40 African states, mainly through the COVAX initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. The French Development Agency provided a €50 million line of credit to Afreximbank for the AVAT payment facility, enabling vaccine purchases by Uganda, Burundi, DRC and Egypt.

We want to work more closely with our African partners on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, One Health and anti-microbial resistance, as well as the health effects of climate change. These are core objectives for our EU Global Health Strategy and the foundations of our cooperation with the African continent. We are now at a critical stage of the negotiations on the pandemic agreement and the international health regulations, with which we would provide new multilateral solutions to common challenges.
