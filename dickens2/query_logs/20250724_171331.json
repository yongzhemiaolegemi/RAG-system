            "description": "Ebenezer Scrooge is the central character in a narrative marked by a profound transformation from a cold, miserly, and grim individual into a joyful, generous, and warm-hearted person. Initially depicted as an old, ill-tempered man characterized by coldness, selfishness, and a solitary nature, Scrooge is harsh and stingy, especially during Christmas. He is bitter toward celebrations and dismissive of charitable efforts, showing little sympathy or warmth toward others, including his nephew and clerk, Bob Cratchit. Physically, he is described as having a pointed nose, shriveled cheeks, red eyes, thin blue lips, and a stiff gait, all of which reflect his emotionally hard and sharp personality. He lives in gloomy chambers formerly belonging to his deceased business partner, Marley, of whom he is the sole executor.\n\nDespite his initial skepticism and fear—particularly when confronted by supernatural visitations, such as the ghost of Marley and subsequent spirits—Scrooge undergoes a supernatural experience involving guided visits from various spirits including the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come. Through these encounters, he reflects deeply on his lonely childhood, past mistakes, present behavior, and the potential grim consequences of his greed and ignorance. Emotional turmoil and self-awareness mark his journey as he observes poignant scenes of social neglect, charity, and the harsh realities faced by others, including the Cratchit family and Tiny Tim, whose frail health particularly moves him.\n\nScrooge’s transformative experience culminates in remorse and penitence. He confronts his own mortality and the ramifications of a life devoid of kindness, leading to a decisive change in character. Following the spirits’ visitations, Scrooge actively embraces generosity and goodwill, raising Bob Cratchit's salary, caring for Tiny Tim, and embodying the true spirit of Christmas. His interactions shift from antagonistic and dismissive to warm, engaging, and joyful, as seen in his participation in family gatherings and festive celebrations. Ultimately, Ebenezer Scrooge becomes a symbol of moral redemption, demonstrating the capacity for self-reflection, change, and compassion toward others.",

He is thoughtful and contemplative but also fearful and curious about supernatural visitations, particularly the Ghost of Jacob Marley, who appears to him as a spectral figure. Scrooge undergoes confusion about the passage of time and engages in profound reflection during these supernatural encounters, including moments where he struggles against the spirits, such as when he caught a spectral hand and was repulsed by a stronger spirit.

He thought, if this man could be raised up\nnow, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard dealing, griping\ncares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\n\nHe lay in the dark, empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child to\nsay he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind\nword I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was\na sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone. What _they_ wanted in\nthe room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge\ndid not dare to think.\n\n'Spirit!' he said, 'this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not\nleave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!'\n\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\n\n'I understand you,' Scrooge returned, 'and I would do it if I could. But\nI have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.'\n\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\n\n'If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this\nman's death,' said Scrooge, quite agonised, 'show that person to me,\nSpirit, I beseech you!'\n\nThe Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing;\nand, withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her\nchildren were.\n\nShe was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked\nup and down the room, started at every sound, looked out from the\nwindow, glanced at the clock, tried, but in vain, to work with her\nneedle, and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play.\n\nAt length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door,\nand met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though\nhe was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now, a kind of\nserious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to\nrepress.\n\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire,\nand when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a\nlong silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\n\n'Is it good,' she said, 'or bad?' to help him.\n\n'Bad,' he answered.\n\n'We are quite ruined?'\n\n'No. There is hope yet, Caroline.'\n\n'If _he_ relents,' she said, amazed, 'there is! Nothing is past hope, if\nsuch a miracle has happened.'\n\n'He is past relenting,' said her husband. 'He is dead.'\n\nShe was a mild and patient creature, if her face spoke truth; but she\nwas thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so with clasped hands.\nShe prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was\nthe emotion of her heart.\n\n'What the half-drunken woman, whom I told you of last night, said to me\nwhen I tried to see him and obtain a week's delay--and what I thought\nwas a mere excuse to avoid me--turns out to have been quite true. He was\nnot only very ill, but dying, then.'\n\n'To whom will our debt be transferred?'\n\n'I don't know. But, before that time, we shall be ready with the money;\nand even though we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so\nmerciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light\nhearts, Caroline!'\n\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's\nfaces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little\nunderstood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's\ndeath! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the\nevent, was one of pleasure.\n\n'Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,' said Scrooge; 'or\nthat dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever\npresent to me.'\n\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet;\nand as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself,\nbut nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house;\nthe dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the\nchildren seated round the fire.\n\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues\nin one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.\nThe mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they\nwere very quiet!\n\n'\"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them.\"'\n\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy\nmust have read them out as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why\ndid he not go on?\n\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her\nface.\n\n'The colour hurts my eyes,' she said.\n\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n\n'They're better now again,' said Cratchit's wife. 'It makes them weak by\ncandle-light; and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes\nhome for the world. It must be near his time.'\n\n'Past it rather,' Peter answered, shutting up his",

Out upon merry Christmas!\nWhat good had it ever done to him?\n\n'The school is not quite deserted,' said the Ghost. 'A solitary child,\nneglected by his friends, is left there still.'\n\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n\nThey left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a\nmansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola\non the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of\nbroken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.\nFowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and\nsheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient\nstate within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the\nopen doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and\nvast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the\nplace, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by\ncandle light and not too much to eat.\n\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back\nof the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\nmelancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\ndesks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and\nScrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as\nhe had used to be.\n\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice\nbehind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed waterspout in the\ndull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent\npoplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a\nclicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening\ninfluence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,\nintent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully\nreal and distinct to look at, stood outside the window, with an axe\nstuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n\n'Why, it's Ali Baba!' Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. 'It's dear old\nhonest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time, when yonder\nsolitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first\ntime, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,' said Scrooge, 'and his\nwild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put\ndown in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him?\nAnd the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon\nhis head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had he to be\nmarried to the Princess?'\n\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such\nsubjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and\nto see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to\nhis business friends in the City, indeed.\n\n'There's the Parrot!' cried Scrooge. 'Green body and yellow tail, with a\nthing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!\nPoor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing\nround the island. \"Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\nCrusoe?\" The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the\nParrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little\ncreek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!'\n\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,\nhe said, in pity for his former self, 'Poor boy!' and cried again.\n\n'I wish,' Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking\nabout him, after drying his eyes with his cuff; 'but it's too late now.'\n\n'What is the matter?' asked the Spirit.\n\n'Nothing,' said Scrooge. 'Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas\ncarol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:\nthat's all.'\n\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,\n'Let us see another Christmas!'\n\nScrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\nlittle darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had\nhappened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\ngone home for the jolly holidays.\n\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\nlooked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\nanxiously towards the door.\n\nIt opened; and a little girl, much",

How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.

If you asked\nme for another penny, and made it an open question, I'd repent of being\nso liberal, and knock off half-a-crown.'\n\n'And now undo _my_ bundle, Joe,' said the first woman.\n\nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it,\nand, having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large heavy\nroll of some dark stuff.\n\n'What do you call this?' said Joe. 'Bed-curtains?'\n\n'Ah!' returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed\narms. 'Bed-curtains!'\n\n'You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and all, with him lying\nthere?' said Joe.\n\n'Yes, I do,' replied the woman. 'Why not?'\n\n'You were born to make your fortune,' said Joe, 'and you'll certainly do\nit.'\n\n'I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by\nreaching it out, for the sake of such a man as he was, I promise you,\nJoe,' returned the woman coolly. 'Don't drop that oil upon the blankets,\nnow.'\n\n'His blankets?' asked Joe.\n\n'Whose else's do you think?' replied the woman. 'He isn't likely to take\ncold without 'em, I dare say.'\n\n'I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?' said old Joe, stopping\nin his work, and looking up.\n\n'Don't you be afraid of that,' returned the woman. 'I an't so fond of\nhis company that I'd loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah!\nyou may look through that shirt till your eyes ache, but you won't find\na hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine\none too. They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.'\n\n'What do you call wasting of it?' asked old Joe.\n\n'Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,' replied the woman, with\na laugh. 'Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If\ncalico an't good enough for such a purpose, it isn't good enough for\nanything. It's quite as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than\nhe did in that one.'\n\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about\ntheir spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he\nviewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been\ngreater, though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse\nitself.\n\n'Ha, ha!' laughed the same woman when old Joe producing a flannel bag\nwith money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. 'This\nis the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he\nwas alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. 'I see, I see. The\ncase of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way now.\nMerciful heaven, what is this?'\n\nHe recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost\ntouched a bed--a bare, uncurtained bed--on which, beneath a ragged\nsheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb,\nannounced itself in awful language.\n\nThe room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy,\nthough Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse,\nanxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the\nouter air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft,\nunwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\n\nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the\nhead. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of\nit, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the\nface. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to\ndo it; but he had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the\nspectre at his side.\n\nOh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and\ndress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command; for this is thy\ndominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head thou canst not\nturn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\nnot that the hand is heavy, and will fall down when released; it is not\nthat the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open,\ngenerous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender, and the pulse a\nman's. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the\nwound, to sow the world with life immortal!\n\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them\nwhen he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up\nnow, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard dealing, griping\ncares?

Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge. 'I am afraid I have not. Have you\nhad many brothers, Spirit?'\n\n'More than eighteen hundred,' said the Ghost.\n\n'A tremendous family to provide for,' muttered Scrooge.\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge submissively, 'conduct me where you will. I went\nforth last night on compulsion, and I learned a lesson which is working\nnow. To-night if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.'\n\n'Touch my robe!'\n\nScrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.\n\nHolly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch,\nall vanished instantly.

'Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room\nhere! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!'\n\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or\ncouldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in\na minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from\npublic life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps\nwere trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as\nsnug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to\nsee upon a winter's night.\n\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and\nmade an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came\nMrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss\nFezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose\nhearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the\nbusiness. In came the housemaid, with her cousin the baker. In came the\ncook with her brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy\nfrom over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his\nmaster; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one,\nwho was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all\ncame, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some\nawkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, any how and\nevery how. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round\nand back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and\nround in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always\nturning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again as soon\nas they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help\nthem! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\nhands to stop the dance, cried out, 'Well done!' and the fiddler plunged\nhis hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose.\nBut, scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again,\nthough there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been\ncarried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\nresolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\n\n[Illustration: _Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs.\nFezziwig_]\n\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and\nthere was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold\nRoast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were\nmince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came\nafter the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The\nsort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told\nit him!) struck up 'Sir Roger de Coverley.' Then old Fezziwig stood\nout to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff\npiece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of\npartners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would\ndance, and had no notion of walking.\n\nBut if they had been twice as many--ah! four times--old Fezziwig would\nhave been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to _her_, she\nwas worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's not\nhigh praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared\nto issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the dance\nlike moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given time, what would\nbecome of them next.

He hasn't left it to _me_.

Bye, bye!'\n\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.\nScrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\n\nThe phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons\nmeeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie\nhere.\n\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very\nwealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing\nwell in their esteem in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a\nbusiness point of view.\n\n'How are you?' said one.\n\n'How are you?' returned the other.\n\n'Well!' said the first, 'old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?'\n\n'So I am told,' returned the second. 'Cold, isn't it?'\n\n'Seasonable for Christmas-time. You are not a skater, I suppose?'\n\n'No, no. Something else to think of. Good-morning!'\n\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their\nparting.\n\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should\nattach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling\nassured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to\nconsider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to\nhave any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was\nPast, and this Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of\nany one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them.\nBut nothing doubting that, to whomsoever they applied, they had some\nlatent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every\nword he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the\nshadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the\nconduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would\nrender the solution of these riddles easy.\n\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image, but another man\nstood in his accustomed corner; and though the clock pointed to his\nusual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among\nthe multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little\nsurprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of\nlife, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out\nin this.\n\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched\nhand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied,\nfrom the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself,\nthat the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder,\nand feel very cold.\n\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,\nwhere Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its\nsituation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shop\nand houses wretched; the people half naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.\nAlleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\nsmell and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets; and the whole\nquarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling\nshop, below a penthouse roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and\ngreasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of\nrusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse\niron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred\nand hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\nsepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\ncharcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly\nseventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without\nby a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and\nsmoked his pipe in all",

The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he\ndreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.\n\n'Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,' said Scrooge,\n'answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will\nbe, or are they shadows of the things that May be only?'\n\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.\n\n'Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in,\nthey must lead,' said Scrooge. 'But if the courses be departed from, the\nends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!'\n\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.\n\nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and, following the\nfinger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name,\nEBENEZER SCROOGE.\n\n'Am I that man who lay upon the bed?' he cried upon his knees.\n\nThe finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\n\n'No, Spirit! Oh no, no!'\n\nThe finger still was there.\n\n'Spirit!' he cried, tight clutching at its robe, 'hear me! I am not the\nman I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this\nintercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope?'\n\nFor the first time the hand appeared to shake.\n\n'Good Spirit,' he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it,\n'your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may\nchange these shadows you have shown me by an altered life?'\n\nThe kind hand trembled.\n\n'I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I\nwill live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all\nThree shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they\nteach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!'\n\nIn his agony he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but\nhe was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit stronger yet,\nrepulsed him.\n\nHolding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw\nan alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress.

Oh, perfectly satisfactory!\n\n'He's a comical old fellow,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'that's the truth;\nand not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their\nown punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.'\n\n'I'm sure he is very rich, Fred,' hinted Scrooge's niece. 'At least, you\nalways tell _me_ so.'\n\n'What of that, my dear?' said Scrooge's nephew. 'His wealth is of no use\nto him. He don't do any good with it. He don't make himself comfortable\nwith it. He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is\never going to benefit Us with it.'\n\n'I have no patience with him,' observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's\nniece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\n\n'Oh, I have!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'I am sorry for him; I couldn't be\nangry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself always.\nHere he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine\nwith us. What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.'\n\n'Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,' interrupted Scrooge's\nniece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have\nbeen competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and with the\ndessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\n\n'Well! I am very glad to hear it,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'because I\nhaven't any great faith in these young housekeepers. What do _you_ say,\nTopper?'\n\nTopper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters,\nfor he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right\nto express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge's niece's\nsister--the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the\nroses--blushed.\n\n'Do go on, Fred,' said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands. 'He never\nfinishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!'\n\nScrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to\nkeep the infection off, though the plump sister tried hard to do it with\naromatic vinegar, his example was unanimously followed.\n\n'I was only going to say,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'that the consequence\nof his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I\nthink, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm.\nI am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own\nthoughts, either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers. I mean\nto give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for\nI pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help\nthinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good\ntemper, year after year, and saying, \"Uncle Scrooge, how are you?\" If it\nonly put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that's_\nsomething; and I think I shook him yesterday.'\n\nIt was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.\nBut being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed\nat, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their\nmerriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.\n\nAfter tea they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew\nwhat they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:\nespecially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one",

Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\nthe act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\nplatter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and\ngratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough\nthat, by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the\nparlour, and, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where\nthey went to bed, and so subsided.\n\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of\nthe house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her\nand her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such\nanother creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have\ncalled him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his\nlife, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n\n'Belle,' said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, 'I saw an\nold friend of yours this afternoon.'\n\n'Who was it?'\n\n'Guess!'\n\n'How can I? Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing\nas he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut\nup, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place.'\n\n'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the\nGhost. 'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling.
