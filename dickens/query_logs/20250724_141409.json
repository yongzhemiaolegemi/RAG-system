Initially portrayed as a tight-fisted old man indifferent to the joys of life and the festive spirit, he expresses disdain for Christmas and social obligations, valuing business and wealth above all else. His contempt for kindness and community is particularly pronounced during the Christmas season, where he embodies a solitary and melancholic disposition, frequently showing unkindness to those around him.\n\nHowever, Scrooge undergoes a significant transformation throughout the story, especially catalyzed by encounters with various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. These supernatural visitations compel him to reflect on his past, present, and future, leading to a deep inner conflict and emotional turmoil. Through these reflections, he experiences moments of vulnerability and regret, grappling with the consequences of his actions and the impact of his miserly ways on himself and others.\n\nAs a result of this transformative journey, Scrooge ultimately embraces the spirit of Christmas, evolving from a cold-hearted and skeptical figure to one who embodies kindness, generosity, and joy. By the end of the narrative, he demonstrates a profound change of heart, actively seeking connection with others and engaging positively in the festive spirit. His character arc illustrates not only the contrast between his initial demeanor and his eventual joy and good intentions but also serves as a critique of greed and an affirmation of community and compassion during the Christmas season.",

Throughout his story, Scrooge initially expresses disdain for Christmas, viewing it as a time of burden rather than a celebration. His cold demeanor and disdain serve as a stark contrast to the warmth and values associated with the holiday, emphasizing the central theme of his character. However, as he reflects on Christmas, he experiences a sense of regret and nostalgia, which highlights his complex feelings towards the holiday.\n\nScrooge's character transformation is significantly influenced by the spirit of Christmas, which catalyzes a shift towards kindness and compassion. He ultimately pledges to honor Christmas in his life, marking a pivotal change in his attitude. This transformation involves recognizing the importance of kindness, generosity, and community during the holiday season, leading to acts of kindness and generosity that were once foreign to him.\n\nAs a result, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas radically evolves, illustrating his development from a bitter misanthrope to a character who embodies the true spirit of the holiday. The journey from disdain to joy reflects the profound impact that the Christmas spirit has on him, highlighting the enduring message of goodwill that the holiday represents.",

They were\nlooking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these\nyoung housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see\nthat everything is right.\n\n'Fred!' said Scrooge.\n\nDear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had\nforgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the\nfootstool, or he wouldn't have done it on any account.\n\n'Why, bless my soul!' cried Fred, 'who's that?'\n\n[Illustration: _\"It's I, your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will\nyou let me in, Fred?\"_]\n\n'It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in,\nFred?'\n\nLet him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off. He was at home in\nfive minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same.\nSo did Topper when _he_ came. So did the plump sister when _she_ came.\nSo did every one when _they_ came. Wonderful party, wonderful games,\nwonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\n\nBut he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there! If\nhe could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That\nwas the thing he had set his heart upon.\n\nAnd he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter\npast. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.\nScrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the\ntank.\n\nHis hat was off before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on\nhis stool in a jiffy, driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to\novertake nine o'clock.\n\n'Hallo!' growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could\nfeign it. 'What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?'\n\n'I am very sorry, sir,' said Bob. 'I _am_ behind my time.'\n\n'You are!' repeated Scrooge. 'Yes, I think you are. Step this way, sir,\nif you please.'\n\n'It's only once a year, sir,' pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. 'It\nshall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.'\n\n'Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,' said Scrooge. 'I am not going to\nstand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,' he continued,\nleaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that\nhe staggered back into the tank again--'and therefore I am about to\nraise your salary!'\n\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary\nidea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the\npeople in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\n\n'A merry Christmas, Bob!' said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could\nnot be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. 'A merrier Christmas,\nBob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I'll raise\nyour salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will\ndiscuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of\nsmoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires and buy another coal-scuttle\nbefore you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!'\n\n[Illustration: _\"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge. \"I\nam not going to stand this sort of thing any longer.\"_]\n\nScrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more;\nand to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as\ngood a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old\nCity knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old\nworld. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them\nlaugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that\nnothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did\nnot have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as\nthese would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they\nshould wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less\nattractive forms. His own heart laughed, and that was quite enough for\nhim.\n\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the\nTotal-Abstinence Principle ever afterwards; and it was always said of\nhim that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed\nthe knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as\nTiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!\n\n[Illustration]\n\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\n|Transcriber's note: The Contents were added by the transcriber.|\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A CHRISTMAS CAROL ***\n\n\n    \n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you",

Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants, who hurried\nup and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in\ngroups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their\ngreat gold seals, and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.\n\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing\nthat the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their\ntalk.\n\n'No,' said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, 'I don't know much\nabout it either way. I only know he's dead.'\n\n'When did he die?' inquired another.\n\n'Last night, I believe.'\n\n'Why, what was the matter with him?' asked a third, taking a vast\nquantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. 'I thought he'd never\ndie.'\n\n'God knows,' said the first, with a yawn.\n\n'What has he done with his money?' asked a red-faced gentleman with a\npendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills\nof a turkey-cock.\n\n'I haven't heard,' said the man with the large chin, yawning again.\n'Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't left it to _me_. That's all\nI know.'\n\nThis pleasantry was received with a general",

Scrooge\nlooked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\nanxiously towards the door.\n\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\nin, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\naddressed him as her 'dear, dear brother.'\n\n'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!' said the child, clapping\nher tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.

And\nyou're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to\ncome back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,\nand have the merriest time in all the world.'\n\n'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy.\n\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,\nbeing too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then\nshe began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and\nhe, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.\n\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box,\nthere!' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on\nMaster Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a\ndreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\nand his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour\nthat ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\nterrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced\na decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,\nand administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at\nthe same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of\n'something' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\nbut, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.\nMaster Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the\nchaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;\nand, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick\nwheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the\nevergreens like spray.\n\n[Illustration: HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSLY LIGHT WINE, AND A\nBLOCK OF CURIOUSLY HEAVY CAKE]\n\n'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said\nthe Ghost. 'But she had a large heart!'\n\n'So she had,' cried Scrooge. 'You're right. I will not gainsay it,\nSpirit. God forbid!'\n\n'She died a woman,' said the Ghost, 'and had, as I think, children.'\n\n'One child,' Scrooge returned.\n\n'True,' said the Ghost. 'Your nephew!'\n\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, 'Yes.'\n\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\nand re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,\nby the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time\nagain; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\n\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\nknew it.\n\n'Know it!' said Scrooge. 'Was I apprenticed here?'\n\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\nexcitement--\n\n'Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!'\n\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which\npointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his\ncapacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his\norgan of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,\njovial voice--\n\n'Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!'\n\nScrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,\naccompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\n\n'Dick Wilkins, to be sure!' said Scrooge to the Ghost.

With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge.\n\n'If quite convenient, sir.'\n\n'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday's wages for no work.'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley's face.\n\nMarley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder.

They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.'\n\n'What do you call wasting of it?' asked old Joe.\n\n'Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,' replied the woman, with\na laugh. 'Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If\ncalico an't good enough for such a purpose, it isn't good enough for\nanything. It's quite as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than\nhe did in that one.'\n\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about\ntheir spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he\nviewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been\ngreater, though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse\nitself.\n\n'Ha, ha!' laughed the same woman when old Joe producing a flannel bag\nwith money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. 'This\nis the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he\nwas alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. 'I see, I see. The\ncase of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way now.\nMerciful heaven, what is this?'\n\nHe recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost\ntouched a bed--a bare, uncurtained bed--on which, beneath a ragged\nsheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb,\nannounced itself in awful language.\n\nThe room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy,\nthough Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse,\nanxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the\nouter air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft,\nunwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\n\nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the\nhead. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of\nit, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the\nface. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to\ndo it; but he had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the\nspectre at his side.\n\nOh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and\ndress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command; for this is thy\ndominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head thou canst not\nturn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\nnot that the hand is heavy, and will fall down when released; it is not\nthat the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open,\ngenerous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender, and the pulse a\nman's. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the\nwound, to sow the world with life immortal!\n\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them\nwhen he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up\nnow, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard dealing, griping\ncares?

But she had scarcely\nentered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was\nclosely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by\nthe sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other.\nAfter a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with\nthe pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\n\n'Let the charwoman alone to be the first!' cried she who had entered\nfirst. 'Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the\nundertaker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's a\nchance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!'\n\n'You couldn't have met in a better place,' said old Joe, removing his\npipe from his mouth. 'Come into the parlour. You were made free of it\nlong ago, you know; and the other two an't strangers. Stop till I shut\nthe door of the shop. Ah! how it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of\nmetal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no\nsuch old bones here as mine. Ha! ha! We're all suitable to our calling,\nwe're well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.'\n\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked\nthe fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky\nlamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put it into his mouth\nagain.\n\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on\nthe floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her\nelbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n\n'What odds, then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?' said the woman. 'Every person\nhas a right to take care of themselves. _He_ always did!'\n\n'That's true, indeed!' said the laundress. 'No man more so.'\n\n'Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman! Who's the\nwiser? We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?'\n\n'No, indeed!' said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. 'We should hope\nnot.'\n\n'Very well then!' cried the woman. 'That's enough. Who's the worse for\nthe loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose?'\n\n'No, indeed,' said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n\n'If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,'\npursued the woman, 'why wasn't he natural in his lifetime? If he had\nbeen, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with\nDeath, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.'\n\n'It's the truest word that ever was spoke,' said Mrs. Dilber. 'It's a\njudgment on him.'\n\n'I wish it was a little heavier judgment,' replied the woman: 'and it\nshould have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands\non anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value\nof it. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for\nthem to see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves\nbefore we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.'\n\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in\nfaded black, mounting the breach first, produced _his_ plunder. It was\nnot extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons,\nand a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined\nand appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give\nfor each upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found\nthat there was nothing more to come.\n\n'That's your account,' said Joe, 'and I wouldn't give another sixpence,\nif I was to be boiled for not doing it.

He hasn't left it to _me_.

Bye, bye!'\n\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.\nScrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\n\nThe phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons\nmeeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie\nhere.\n\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very\nwealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing\nwell in their esteem in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a\nbusiness point of view.\n\n'How are you?' said one.\n\n'How are you?' returned the other.\n\n'Well!' said the first, 'old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?'\n\n'So I am told,' returned the second. 'Cold, isn't it?'\n\n'Seasonable for Christmas-time. You are not a skater, I suppose?'\n\n'No, no. Something else to think of. Good-morning!'\n\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their\nparting.\n\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should\nattach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling\nassured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to\nconsider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to\nhave any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was\nPast, and this Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of\nany one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them.\nBut nothing doubting that, to whomsoever they applied, they had some\nlatent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every\nword he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the\nshadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the\nconduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would\nrender the solution of these riddles easy.\n\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image, but another man\nstood in his accustomed corner; and though the clock pointed to his\nusual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among\nthe multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little\nsurprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of\nlife, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out\nin this.\n\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched\nhand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied,\nfrom the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself,\nthat the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder,\nand feel very cold.\n\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,\nwhere Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its\nsituation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shop\nand houses wretched; the people half naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.\nAlleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\nsmell and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets; and the whole\nquarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling\nshop, below a penthouse roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and\ngreasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of\nrusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse\niron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred\nand hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\nsepulchres of bones.

Show me no\nmore!'\n\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him\nto observe what happened next.\n\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or\nhandsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful\nyoung girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,\nuntil he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more\nchildren there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty\nchildren conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting\nitself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\nruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I\nnever could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all\nthe world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the\nprecious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul!\nto save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold\nyoung brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to\nhave grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And\nyet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\nquestioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the\nlashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose\nwaves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in\nshort, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest\nlicense of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.\n\n[Illustration: _A flushed and boisterous group_]\n\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately\nensued that she, with laughing face and plundered dress, was borne\ntowards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to\ngreet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas\ntoys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter!

            "content": "Merry\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several\nhomes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!\nWhat good had it ever done to him?\n\n'The school is not quite deserted,' said the Ghost. 'A solitary child,\nneglected by his friends, is left there still.'\n\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n\nThey left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a\nmansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola\non the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of\nbroken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.\nFowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and\nsheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient\nstate within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the\nopen doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and\nvast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the\nplace, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by\ncandle light and not too much to eat.\n\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back\nof the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\nmelancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\ndesks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and\nScrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as\nhe had used to be.\n\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice\nbehind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed waterspout in the\ndull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent\npoplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a\nclicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening\ninfluence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,\nintent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully\nreal and distinct to look at, stood outside the window, with an axe\nstuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n\n'Why, it's Ali Baba!' Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. 'It's dear old\nhonest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time, when yonder\nsolitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first\ntime, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,' said Scrooge, 'and his\nwild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put\ndown in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him?\nAnd the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon\nhis head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had he to be\nmarried to the Princess?'\n\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such\nsubjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and\nto see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to\nhis business friends in the City, indeed.\n\n'There's the Parrot!' cried Scrooge. 'Green body and yellow tail, with a\nthing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!\nPoor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing\nround the island. \"Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\nCrusoe?\" The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the\nParrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little\ncreek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!'\n\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,\nhe said, in pity for his former self, 'Poor boy!' and cried again.\n\n'I wish,' Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking\nabout him, after drying his eyes with his cuff; 'but it's too late now.'\n\n'What is the matter?' asked the Spirit.\n\n'Nothing,' said Scrooge. 'Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas\ncarol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:\nthat's all.'\n\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,\n'Let us see another Christmas!'\n\nScrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\nlittle darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had\nhappened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\ngone home for the jolly holidays.\n\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\nlooked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\nanxiously towards the door.\n\nIt opened; and a little girl, much",

            "content": "It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'\n\n'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in\noperation?'\n\n'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were\nnot.'\n\n'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.\n\n'Both very busy, sir.'\n\n'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very\nglad to hear it.'\n\n'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\nor body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?'\n\n'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.\n\n'You wish to be anonymous?'\n\n'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.'\n\n'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'\n\n'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'\n\n'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.\n\n'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his",
