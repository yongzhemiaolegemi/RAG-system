OVERVIEW
The World Health Organization (WHO) African Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group (RITAG) serves as the principal advisory group to WHO African regional Director for strategic guidance on overall regional policies and strategies for vaccines and Immunization. The mandate of RITAG is focused on an integrated, people-centered platform of disease prevention covering the control of vaccine-preventable diseases along the life-course spectrum through the context of health systems strengthening. RITAG works under the framework of WHO-adopted global andregional strategies ranging from vaccine research and development to delivery of routine Immunization services and linkages with other health interventions.
The first post-COVID-19 pandemic in-person meeting of RITAG took place at the WHO Regional Office for Africa (WHO/AFRO), in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo from 07 to 09 November 2023. During the meeting RITAG reviewed the progress, successes, and challenges of Immunization in the WHO African region, as well as the lessons learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic. The three-day meeting also provided an opportunity to reflect on current priorities, future direction, and key strategic shifts needed to get the region back on track towards achieving the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) goals and targets.
Following consultation with the Chair of RITAG, Professor Helen Rees, the next meeting of RITAG has been scheduled for Request for 11-14 June 2024 in Kigali, Rwanda. The planned RITAG meeting will provide a platform for in-depth discussions by leveraging the collective expertise and experiences of the RITAG members and set the stage for collaborative action towards advancing planned goals of Immunization and vaccine-preventable disease control within the region.
